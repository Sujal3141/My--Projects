              "'Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeNarnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeNarnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch and The WardrobeBY Lewis, C. S.Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER ONELUCY LOOKS INTO A WARDROBEONCE there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmundand Lucy. This story is about something that happened to them when they weresent away from London during the war because of the air-raids. They were sentto the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the country, ten milesfrom the nearest railway station and two miles from the nearest post office. Hehad no wife and he lived in a very large house with a housekeeper called MrsMacready and three servants. (Their names were Ivy, Margaret and Betty, butthey do not come into the story much.) He himself was a very old man withshaggy white hair which grew over most of his face as well as on his head, andthey liked him almost at once; but on the first evening when he came out to meetthem at the front door he was so odd-looking that Lucy (who was the youngest)was a little afraid of him, and Edmund (who was the next youngest) wanted tolaugh and had to keep on pretending he was blowing his nose to hide it.As soon as they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on thefirst night, the boys came into the girls’ room and they all talked it over.“We’ve fallen on our feet and no mistake,” said Peter. “This is going to beperfectly splendid. That old chap will let us do anything we like.”“I think he’s an old dear,” said Susan.“Oh, come off it!” said Edmund, who was tired and pretending not to betired, which always made him bad-tempered. “Don’t go on talking like that.”“Like what?” said Susan; “and anyway, it’s time you were in bed.”“Trying to talk like Mother,” said Edmund. “And who are you to say whenI’m to go to bed? Go to bed yourself.”“Hadn’t we all better go to bed?” said Lucy. “There’s sure to be a row ifwe’re heard talking here.”“No there won’t,” said Peter. “I tell you this is the sort of house where noone’s going to mind what we do. Anyway, they won’t hear us. It’s about tenminutes’ walk from here down to that dining-room, and any amount of stairs andpassages in between.”“What’s that noise?” said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than shehad ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and rows ofdoors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy.“It’s only a bird, silly,” said Edmund.“It’s an owl,” said Peter. “This is going to be a wonderful place for birds. Ishall go to bed now. I say, let’s go and explore tomorrow. You might findanything in a place like this. Did you see those mountains as we came along?And the woods? There might be eagles. There might be stags. There’ll behawks.”“Badgers!” said Lucy.“Foxes!” said Edmund.“Rabbits!” said Susan.But when next morning came there was a steady rain falling, so thick thatwhen you looked out of the window you could see neither the mountains nor thewoods nor even the stream in the garden.“Of course it would be raining!” said Edmund. They had just finished theirbreakfast with the Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set apart forthem - a long, low room with two windows looking out in one direction and twoin another.“Do stop grumbling, Ed,” said Susan. “Ten to one it’ll clear up in an hour orso. And in the meantime we’re pretty well off. There’s a wireless and lots ofbooks.”“Not for me”said Peter; “I’m going to explore in the house.”Everyone agreed to this and that was how the adventures began. It was thesort of house that you never seem to come to the end of, and it was full ofunexpected places. The first few doors they tried led only into spare bedrooms,as everyone had expected that they would; but soon they came to a very longroom full of pictures and there they found a suit of armour; and after that was aroom all hung with green, with a harp in one corner; and then came three stepsdown and five steps up, and then a kind of little upstairs hall and a door that ledout on to a balcony, and then a whole series of rooms that led into each other andwere lined with books - most of them very old books and some bigger than aBible in a church. And shortly after that they looked into a room that was quiteempty except for one big wardrobe; the sort that has a looking-glass in the door.There was nothing else in the room at all except a dead blue-bottle on thewindow-sill.“Nothing there!” said Peter, and they all trooped out again - all except Lucy.She stayed behind because she thought it would be worth while trying the doorof the wardrobe, even though she felt almost sure that it would be locked. To hersurprise it opened quite easily, and two moth-balls dropped out.Looking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up - mostly long furcoats. There was nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. Sheimmediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coats and rubbedher face against them, leaving the door open, of course, because she knew that itis very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe. Soon she went further in andfound that there was a second row of coats hanging up behind the first one. Itwas almost quite dark in there and she kept her arms stretched out in front of herso as not to bump her face into the back of the wardrobe. She took a step furtherin - then two or three steps always expecting to feel woodwork against the tips ofher fingers. But she could not feel it.“This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!” thought Lucy, going stillfurther in and pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her.Then she noticed that there was something crunching under her feet. “I wonderis that more mothballs?” she thought, stooping down to feel it with her hand. Butinstead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she feltsomething soft and powdery and extremely cold. “This is very queer,” she said,and went on a step or two further.Next moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and handswas no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly. “Why, itis just like branches of trees!” exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw that there wasa light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobeought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling onher. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood atnight-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air.Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well.She looked back over her shoulder and there, between the dark tree trunks; shecould still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of theempty room from which she had set out. (She had, of course, left the door open,for she knew that it is a very silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe.) Itseemed to be still daylight there. “I can always get back if anything goes wrong,”thought Lucy. She began to walk forward, crunch-crunch over the snow andthrough the wood towards the other light. In about ten minutes she reached it andfound it was a lamp-post. As she stood looking at it, wondering why there was alamp-post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next, she heard apitter patter of feet coming towards her. And soon after that a very strangeperson stepped out from among the trees into the light of the lamp-post.He was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head anumbrella, white with snow. From the waist upwards he was like a man, but hislegs were shaped like a goat’s (the hair on them was glossy black) and instead offeet he had goat’s hoofs. He also had a tail, but Lucy did not notice this at firstbecause it was neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so as to keepit from trailing in the snow. He had a red woollen muffler round his neck and hisskin was rather reddish too. He had a strange, but pleasant little face, with a shortpointed beard and curly hair, and out of the hair there stuck two horns, one oneach side of his forehead. One of his hands, as I have said, held the umbrella: inthe other arm he carried several brown-paper parcels. What with the parcels andthe snow it looked just as if he had been doing his Christmas shopping. He was aFaun. And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped allhis parcels.“Goodness gracious me!” exclaimed the Faun.Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER TWOWHAT LUCY FOUND THERE“GOOD EVENING,” said Lucy. But the Faun was so busy picking up itsparcels that at first it did not reply. When it had finished it made her a little bow.“Good evening, good evening,” said the Faun. “Excuse me - I don’t want tobe inquisitive - but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve?”“My name’s Lucy,” said she, not quite understanding him.“But you are - forgive me - you are what they call a girl?” said the Faun.“Of course I’m a girl,” said Lucy.“You are in fact Human?”“Of course I’m human,” said Lucy, still a little puzzled.“To be sure, to be sure,” said the Faun. “How stupid of me! But I’ve neverseen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before. I am delighted. That is to say-” and then it stopped as if it had been going to say something it had not intendedbut had remembered in time. “Delighted, delighted,” it went on. “Allow me tointroduce myself. My name is Tumnus.”“I am very pleased to meet you, Mr Tumnus,” said Lucy.“And may I ask, O Lucy Daughter of Eve,” said Mr Tumnus, “how you havecome into Narnia?”“Narnia? What’s that?” said Lucy.“This is the land of Narnia,” said the Faun, “where we are now; all that liesbetween the lamp-post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea.And you - you have come from the wild woods of the west?”“I - I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room,” said Lucy.“Ah!” said Mr Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice, “if only I had workedharder at geography when I was a little Faun, I should no doubt know all aboutthose strange countries. It is too late now.”“But they aren’t countries at all,” said Lucy, almost laughing. “It’s only justback there - at least - I’m not sure. It is summer there.”“Meanwhile,” said Mr Tumnus, “it is winter in Narnia, and has been for everso long, and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow.Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reignsaround the bright city of War Drobe, how would it be if you came and had teawith me?”“Thank you very much, Mr Tumnus,” said Lucy. “But I was wonderingwhether I ought to be getting back.”“It’s only just round the corner,” said the Faun, “and there’ll be a roaring fire- and toast - and sardines - and cake.”“Well, it’s very kind of you,” said Lucy. “But I shan’t be able to stay long.”“If you will take my arm, Daughter of Eve,” said Mr Tumnus, “I shall beable to hold the umbrella over both of us. That’s the way. Now - off we go.”And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with thisstrange creature as if they had known one another all their lives.They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground becamerough and there were rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down. Atthe bottom of one small valley Mr Tumnus turned suddenly aside as if he weregoing to walk straight into an unusually large rock, but at the last moment Lucyfound he was leading her into the entrance of a cave. As soon as they were insideshe found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire. Then Mr Tumnus stoopedand took a flaming piece of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs,and lit a lamp. “Now we shan’t be long,” he said, and immediately put a kettleon.Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place. It was a little, dry, cleancave of reddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs (”one for meand one for a friend,” said Mr Tumnus) and a table and a dresser and amantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with a greybeard. In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought must lead to MrTumnus’s bedroom, and on one wall was a shelf full of books. Lucy looked atthese while he was setting out the tea things. They had titles like The Life andLetters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men, Monks and Gamekeepers;a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth?“Now, Daughter of Eve!” said the Faun.And really it was a wonderful tea. There was a nice brown egg, lightlyboiled, for each of them, and then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, andthen toast with honey, and then a sugar-topped cake. And when Lucy was tiredof eating the Faun began to talk. He had wonderful tales to tell of life in theforest. He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in thewells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns;about long hunting parties after the milk-white stag who could give you wishesif you caught him; about feasting and treasure-seeking with the wild Red Dwarfsin deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor; and then about summerwhen the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come tovisit them, and sometimes Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run withwine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollificationfor weeks on end. “Not that it isn’t always winter now,” he added gloomily. Thento cheer himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange little flutethat looked as if it were made of straw and began to play. And the tune he playedmade Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time.It must have been hours later when she shook herself and said:“Oh, Mr Tumnus - I’m so sorry to stop you, and I do love that tune - butreally, I must go home. I only meant to stay for a few minutes.”“It’s no good now, you know,” said the Faun, laying down its flute andshaking its head at her very sorrowfully.“No good?” said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather frightened. “What doyou mean? I’ve got to go home at once. The others will be wondering what hashappened to me.” But a moment later she asked, “Mr Tumnus! Whatever is thematter?” for the Faun’s brown eyes had filled with tears and then the tears begantrickling down its cheeks, and soon they were running off the end of its nose;and at last it covered its face with its hands and began to howl.“Mr Tumnus! Mr Tumnus!” said Lucy in great distress. “Don’t! Don’t! Whatis the matter? Aren’ you well? Dear Mr Tumnus, do tell me what is wrong.” Butthe Faun continued sobbing as if its heart would break. And even when Lucywent over and put her arms round him and lent him her hand kerchief, he did notstop. He merely took the handker chief and kept on using it, wringing it out withboth hands whenever it got too wet to be any more use, so that presently Lucywas standing in a damp patch.“Mr Tumnus!” bawled Lucy in his ear, shaking him. “Do stop. Stop it atonce! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a great big Faun like you. What onearth are you crying about?”“Oh - oh - oh!” sobbed Mr Tumnus, “I’m crying because I’m such a badFaun.”“I don’t think you’re a bad Faun at all,” said Lucy. “I think you are a verygood Faun. You are the nicest Faun I’ve ever met.”“Oh - oh - you wouldn’t say that if you knew,” replied Mr Tumnus betweenhis sobs. “No, I’m a bad Faun. I don’t suppose there ever was a worse Faun sincethe beginning of the world.”“But what have you done?” asked Lucy.“My old father, now,” said Mr Tumnus; “that’s his picture over themantelpiece. He would never have done a thing like this.”“A thing like what?” said Lucy.“Like what I’ve done,” said the Faun. “Taken service under the White Witch.That’s what I am. I’m in the pay of the White Witch.”“The White Witch? Who is she?”“Why, it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb. It’s she that makes italways winter. Always winter and never Christmas; think of that!”“How awful!” said Lucy. “But what does she pay you for?”“That’s the worst of it,” said Mr Tumnus with a deep groan. “I’m akidnapper for her, that’s what I am. Look at me, Daughter of Eve. Would youbelieve that I’m the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood, onethat had never done me any harm, and pretend to be friendly with it, and invite ithome to my cave, all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over tothe White Witch?”“No,” said Lucy. “I’m sure you wouldn’t do anything of the sort.”“But I have,” said the Faun.“Well,” said Lucy rather slowly (for she wanted to be truthful and yet not betoo hard on him), “well, that was pretty bad. But you’re so sorry for it that I’msure you will never do it again.”“Daughter of Eve, don’t you understand?” said the Faun. “It isn’t somethingI have done. I’m doing it now, this very moment.”“What do you mean?” cried Lucy, turning very white.“You are the child,” said Tumnus. “I had orders from the White Witch that ifever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood, I was to catch themand hand them over to her. And you are the first I’ve ever met. And I’vepretended to be your friend an asked you to tea, and all the time I’ve beenmeaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell Her.”“Oh, but you won’t, Mr Tumnus,” said Lucy. “Yo won’t, will you? Indeed,indeed you really mustn’t.”“And if I don’t,” said he, beginning to cry again “she’s sure to find out. Andshe’ll have my tail cut off and my horns sawn off, and my beard plucked out,and she’ll wave her wand over my beautiful clove hoofs and turn them intohorrid solid hoofs like wretched horse’s. And if she is extra and specially angryshe’ll turn me into stone and I shall be only statue of a Faun in her horriblehouse until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled and goodness knows whenthat will happen, or whether it will ever happen at all.”“I’m very sorry, Mr Tumnus,” said Lucy. “But please let me go home.”“Of course I will,” said the Faun. “Of course I’ve got to. I see that now. Ihadn’t known what Humans were like before I met you. Of course I can’t giveyou up to the Witch; not now that I know you. But we must be off at once. I’llsee you back to the lamp-post. I suppose you can find your own way from thereback to Spare Oom and War Drobe?”“I’m sure I can,” said Lucy.“We must go as quietly as we can,” said Mr Tumnus. “The whole wood isfull of her spies. Even some of the trees are on her side.”They both got up and left the tea things on the table, and Mr Tumnus oncemore put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm, and they went out into thesnow. The journey back was not at all like the journey to the Faun’s cave; theystole along as quickly as they could, without speaking a word, and Mr Tumnuskept to the darkest places. Lucy was relieved when they reached the lamp-postagain.“Do you know your way from here, Daughter o Eve?” said Tumnus.Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance apatch of light that looked like daylight. “Yes,” she said, “I can see the wardrobedoor.”“Then be off home as quick as you can,” said the Faun, “and - c-can you everforgive me for what meant to do?”“Why, of course I can,” said Lucy, shaking him heartily by the hand. “And Ido hope you won’t get into dreadful trouble on my account.”“Farewell, Daughter of Eve,” said he. “Perhaps I may keep thehandkerchief?”“Rather!” said Lucy, and then ran towards the far off patch of daylight asquickly as her legs would carry her. And presently instead of rough branchbrushing past her she felt coats, and instead of crunching snow under her feet shefelt wooden board and all at once she found herself jumping out of the wardrobeinto the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started. She shutthe wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around, panting for breath. Itwas still raining and she could hear the voices of the others in the passage.“I’m here,” she shouted. “I’m here. I’ve come back I’m all right.”Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER THREEEDMUND AND THE WARDROBELucy ran out of the empty room into the passage and found the other three.“It’s all right,” she repeated, “I’ve comeback.”“What on earth are you talking about, Lucy?” asked Susan.“Why? said Lucy in amazement, “haven’t you all been wondering where Iwas?”“So you’ve been hiding, have you?” said Peter. “Poor old Lu, hiding andnobody noticed! You’ll have to hide longer than that if you want people to startlooking for you.”“But I’ve been away for hours and hours,” said Lucy.The others all stared at one another.“Batty!” said Edmund, tapping his head. “Quite batty.”“What do you mean, Lu?” asked Peter.“What I said,” answered Lucy. “It was just after breakfast when I went intothe wardrobe, and I’ve been away for hours and hours, and had tea, and all sortsof things have happened.”“Don’t be silly, Lucy,” said Susan. “We’ve only just come out of that room amoment ago, and you were there then.”“She’s not being silly at all,” said Peter, “she’s just making up a story for fun,aren’t you, Lu? And why shouldn’t she?”“No, Peter, I’m not,” she said. “It’s - it’s a magic wardrobe. There’s a woodinside it, and it’s snowing, and there’s a Faun and a Witch and it’s called Narnia;come and see.”The others did not know what to think, but Lucy was so excited that they allwent back with her into the room. She rushed ahead of them, flung open the doorof the wardrobe and cried, “Now! go in and see for yourselves.”“Why, you goose,” said Susan, putting her head inside and pulling the furcoats apart, “it’s just an ordinary wardrobe; look! there’s the back of it.”Then everyone looked in and pulled the coats apart; and they all saw - Lucyherself saw - a perfectly ordinary wardrobe. There was no wood and no snow,only the back of the wardrobe, with hooks on it. Peter went in and rapped hisknuckles on it to make sure that it was solid.“A jolly good hoax, Lu,” he said as he came out again; “you have reallytaken us in, I must admit. We half believed you.”“But it wasn’t a hoax at all,” said Lucy, “really and truly. It was all differenta moment ago. Honestly it was. I promise.”“Come, Lu,” said Peter, “that’s going a bit far. You’ve had your joke. Hadn’tyou better drop it now?”Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something, though she hardlyknew what she was trying to say, and burst into tears.For the next few days she was very miserable. She could have made it upwith the others quite easily at any moment if she could have brought herself tosay that the whole thing was only a story made up for fun. But Lucy was a verytruthful girl and she knew that she was really in the right; and she could notbring herself to say this. The others who thought she was telling a lie, and a sillylie too, made her very unhappy. The two elder ones did this without meaning todo it, but Edmund could be spiteful, and on this occasion he was spiteful. Hesneered and jeered at Lucy and kept on asking her if she’d found any other newcountries in other cupboards all over the house. What made it worse was thatthese days ought to have been delightful. The weather was fine and they wereout of doors from morning to night, bathing, fishing, climbing trees, and lying inthe heather. But Lucy could not properly enjoy any of it. And so things went onuntil the next wet day.That day, when it came to the afternoon and there was still no sign of a breakin the weather, they decided to play hide-and-seek. Susan was “It” and as soon asthe others scattered to hide, Lucy went to the room where the wardrobe was. Shedid not mean to hide in the wardrobe, because she knew that would only set theothers talking again about the whole wretched business. But she did want to haveone more look inside it; for by this time she was beginning to wonder herselfwhether Narnia and the Faun had not been a dream. The house was so large andcomplicated and full of hiding-places that she thought she would have time tohave one look into the wardrobe and then hide somewhere else. But as soon asshe reached it she heard steps in the passage outside, and then there was nothingfor it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her. She didnot shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into awardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.Now the steps she had heard were those of Edmund; and he came into theroom just in time to see Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He at once decided toget into it himself - not because he thought it a particularly good place to hidebut because he wanted to go on teasing her about her imaginary country. Heopened the door. There were the coats hanging up as usual, and a smell ofmothballs, and darkness and silence, and no sign of Lucy. “She thinks I’m Susancome to catch her,” said Edmund to himself, “and so she’s keeping very quiet inat the back.” He jumped in and shut the door, forgetting what a very foolishthing this is to do. Then he began feeling about for Lucy in the dark. He hadexpected to find her in a few seconds and was very surprised when he did not.He decided to open the door again and let in some light. But he could not findthe door either. He didn’t like this at all and began groping wildly in everydirection; he even shouted out, “Lucy! Lu! Where are you? I know you’re here.”There was no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a curioussound - not the sound you expect in a cupboard, but a kind of open-air sound. Healso noticed that he was unexpectedly cold; and then he saw a light.“Thank goodness,” said Edmund, “the door must have swung open of itsown accord.” He forgot all about Lucy and went towards the light, which hethought was the open door of the wardrobe. But instead of finding himselfstepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out from the shadowof some thick dark fir trees into an open place in the middle of a wood.There was crisp, dry snow under his feet and more snow lying on thebranches of the trees. Overhead there was pale blue sky, the sort of sky one seeson a fine winter day in the morning. Straight ahead of him he saw between thetree-trunks the sun, just rising, very red and clear. Everything was perfectly still,as if he were the only living creature in that country. There was not even a robinor a squirrel among the trees, and the wood stretched as far as he could see inevery direction. He shivered.He now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy; and also howunpleasant he had been to her about her “imaginary country” which now turnedout not to have been imaginary at all. He thought that she must be somewherequite close and so he shouted, “Lucy! Lucy! I’m here too-Edmund.”There was no answer.“She’s angry about all the things I’ve been saying lately,” thought Edmund.And though he did not like to admit that he had been wrong, he also did notmuch like being alone in this strange, cold, quiet place; so he shouted again.“I say, Lu! I’m sorry I didn’t believe you. I see now you were right all along.Do come out. Make it Pax.”Still there was no answer.“Just like a girl,” said Edmund to himself, “sulking somewhere, and won’taccept an apology.” He looked round him again and decided he did not muchlike this place, and had almost made up his mind to go home, when he heard,very far off in the wood, a sound of bells. He listened and the sound came nearerand nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer.The reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies and their hair was sowhite that even the snow hardly looked white compared with them; theirbranching horns were gilded and shone like something on fire when the sunrisecaught them. Their harness was of scarlet leather and covered with bells. On thesledge, driving the reindeer, sat a fat dwarf who would have been about threefeet high if he had been standing. He was dressed in polar bear’s fur and on hishead he wore a red hood with a long gold tassel hanging down from its point; hishuge beard covered his knees and served him instead of a rug. But behind him,on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very different person - agreat lady, taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen. She also wascovered in white fur up to her throat and held a long straight golden wand in herright hand and wore a golden crown on her head. Her face was white - notmerely pale, but white like snow or paper or icing-sugar, except for her very redmouth. It was a beautiful face in other respects, but proud and cold and stern.The sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping towards Edmund with thebells jingling and the dwarf cracking his whip and the snow flying up on eachside of it.“Stop!” said the Lady, and the dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharp that theyalmost sat down. Then they recovered themselves and stood champing their bitsand blowing. In the frosty air the breath coming out of their nostrils looked likesmoke.“And what, pray, are you?” said the Lady, looking hard at Edmund.“I’m-I’m-my name’s Edmund,” said Edmund rather awkwardly. He did notlike the way she looked at him.The Lady frowned, “Is that how you address a Queen?” she asked, lookingsterner than ever.“I beg your pardon, your Majesty, I didn’t know,” said Edmund:“Not know the Queen of Narnia?” cried she. “Ha! You shall know us betterhereafter. But I repeat-what are you?”“Please, your Majesty,” said Edmund, “I don’t know what you mean. I’m atschool - at least I was it’s the holidays now.”Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER FOURTURKISH DELIGHT“BUT what are you?” said the Queen again. “Are you a great overgrowndwarf that has cut off its beard?”“No, your Majesty,” said Edmund, “I never had a beard, I’m a boy.”“A boy!” said she. “Do you mean you are a Son of Adam?”Edmund stood still, saying nothing. He was too confused by this time tounderstand what the question meant.“I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be,” said the Queen. “Answerme, once and for all, or I shall lose my patience. Are you human?”“Yes, your Majesty,” said Edmund.“And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?”“Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe.”“A wardrobe? What do you mean?”“I - I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty,” said Edmund.“Ha!” said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him. “A door. A doorfrom the world of men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck all. But heis only one, and he is easily dealt with.” As she spoke these words she rose fromher seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes flaming; at the samemoment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that she was going to dosomething dreadful but he seemed unable to move. Then, just as he gave himselfup for lost, she appeared to change her mind.“My poor child,” she said in quite a different voice, “how cold you look!Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle round you andwe will talk.”Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; hestepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantleround him and tucked it well in.“Perhaps something hot to drink?” said the Queen. “Should you like that?”“Yes please, your Majesty,” said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.The Queen took from somewhere among her wrappings a very small bottlewhich looked as if it were made of copper. Then, holding out her arm, she letone drop fall from it on the snow beside the sledge. Edmund saw the drop for asecond in mid-air, shining like a diamond. But the moment it touched the snowthere was a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something thatsteamed. The dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bowand a smile; not a very nice smile. Edmund felt much better as he began to sipthe hot drink. It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamyand creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.“It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating,” said the Queen presently.“What would you like best to eat?”“Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty,” said Edmund.The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantlythere appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened,turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece wassweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything moredelicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmundtried to remember that it is rude to speak with one’s mouth full, but soon heforgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much TurkishDelight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he neverasked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell herthat he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had alreadybeen in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and hisbrother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia. She seemed especiallyinterested in the fact that there were four of them, and kept on coming back to it.“You are sure there are just four of you?” she asked. “Two Sons of Adam andtwo Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?” and Edmund, with his mouth fullof Turkish Delight, kept on saying, “Yes, I told you that before,” and forgettingto call her “Your Majesty”, but she didn’t seem to mind now.At last the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking veryhard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would likesome more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking; for sheknew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and thatanyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even,if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did notoffer him any more. Instead, she said to him,“Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your twosisters. Will you bring them to see me?”“I’ll try,” said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.“Because, if you did come again - bringing them with you of course - I’d beable to give you some more Turkish Delight. I can’t do it now, the magic willonly work once. In my own house it would be another matter.”“Why can’t we go to your house now?” said Edmund. When he had first goton to the sledge he had been afraid that she might drive away with him to someunknown place from which he would not be able to get back; but he hadforgotten about that fear now.“It is a lovely place, my house,” said the Queen. “I am sure you would like it.There are whole rooms full of Turkish Delight, and what’s more, I have nochildren of my own. I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as a Prince andwho would be King of Narnia when I am gone. While he was Prince he wouldwear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long; and you are much thecleverest and handsomest young man I’ve ever met. I think I would like to makeyou the Prince - some day, when you bring the others to visit me.”“Why not now?” said Edmund. His face had become very red and his mouthand fingers were sticky. He did not look either clever or handsome, whatever theQueen might say.“Oh, but if I took you there now,” said she, “I shouldn’t see your brother andyour sisters. I very much want to know your charming relations. You are to bethe Prince and - later on - the King; that is understood. But you must havecourtiers and nobles. I will make your brother a Duke and your sistersDuchesses.”“There’s nothing special about them,” said Edmund, “and, anyway, I couldalways bring them some other time.”“Ah, but once you were in my house,” said the Queen, “you might forget allabout thern. You would be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn’t want thebother of going to fetch them. No. You must go back to your own country nowand come to me another day, with them, you understand. It is no good comingwithout them.”“But I don’t even know the way back to my own country,” pleaded Edmund.“That’s easy,” answered the Queen. “Do you see that lamp?” She pointed withher wand and Edmund turned and saw the same lamp-post under which Lucyhad met the Faun. “Straight on, beyond that, is the way to the World of Men.And now look the other way’- here she pointed in the opposite direction - “andtell me if you can see two little hills rising above the trees.”“I think I can,” said Edmund.“Well, my house is between those two hills. So next time you come you haveonly to find the lamp-post and look for those two hills and walk through thewood till you reach my house. But remember - you must bring the others withyou. I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone.”“I’ll do my best,” said Edmund.“And, by the way,” said the Queen, “you needn’t tell them about me. Itwould be fun to keep it a secret between us two, wouldn’t it? Make it a surprisefor them. Just bring them along to the two hills - a clever boy like you will easilythink of some excuse for doing that - and when you come to my house you couldjust say “Let’s see who lives here” or something like that. I am sure that wouldbe best. If your sister has met one of the Fauns, she may have heard strangestories about me - nasty stories that might make her afraid to come to me. Faunswill say anything, you know, and now -““Please, please,” said Edmund suddenly, “please couldn’t I have just onepiece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home?”“No, no,” said the Queen with a laugh, “you must wait till next time.” Whileshe spoke, she signalled to the dwarf to drive on, but as the sledge swept awayout of sight, the Queen waved to Edmund, calling out, “Next time! Next time!Don’t forget. Come soon.”Edmund was still staring after the sledge when he heard someone calling hisown name, and looking round he saw Lucy coming towards him from anotherpart of the wood.“Oh, Edmund!” she cried. “So you’ve got in too! Isn’t it wonderful, andnow-““All right,” said Edmund, “I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobeafter all. I’ll say I’m sorry if you like. But where on earth have you been all thistime? I’ve been looking for you everywhere.”“If I’d known you had got in I’d have waited for you,” said Lucy, who wastoo happy and excited to notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how flushedand strange his face was. “I’ve been having lunch with dear Mr Tumnus, theFaun, and he’s very well and the White Witch has done nothing to him for lettingme go, so he thinks she can’t have found out and perhaps everything is going tobe all right after all.”“The White Witch?” said Edmund; “who’s she?”“She is a perfectly terrible person,” said Lucy. “She calls herself the Queenof Narnia though she has no right to be queen at all, and all the Fauns andDryads and Naiads and Dwarfs and Animals - at least all the good ones - simplyhate her. And she can turn people into stone and do all kinds of horrible things.And she has made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia - always winter,but it never gets to Christmas. And she drives about on a sledge, drawn byreindeer, with her wand in her hand and a crown on her head.”Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too manysweets, and when he heard that the Lady he had made friends with was adangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable. But he still wanted to tastethat Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else.“Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch?” he asked.“Mr Tumnus, the Faun,” said Lucy.“You can’t always believe what Fauns say,” said Edmund, trying to sound asif he knew far more about them than Lucy.“Who said so?” asked Lucy.“Everyone knows it,” said Edmund; “ask anybody you like. But it’s prettypoor sport standing here in the snow. Let’s go home.”“Yes, let’s,” said Lucy. “Oh, Edmund, I am glad you’ve got in too. Theothers will have to believe in Narnia now that both of us have been there. Whatfun it will be!”But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be as good fun for him as forher. He would have to admit that Lucy had been right, before all the others, andhe felt sure the others would all be on the side of the Fauns and the animals; buthe was already more than half on the side of the Witch. He did not know what hewould say, or how he would keep his secret once they were all talking aboutNarnia.By this time they had walked a good way. Then suddenly they felt coatsaround them instead of branches and next moment they were both standingoutside the wardrobe in the empty room.“I say,” said Lucy, “you do look awful, Edmund. Don’t you feel well?”“I’m all right,” said Edmund, but this was not true. He was feeling very sick.“Come on then,” said Lucy, “let’s find the others. What a lot we shall have totell them! And what wonderful adventures we shall have now that we’re all in ittogether.”Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER FIVEBACK ON THIS SIDE OF THE DOORBECAUSE the game of hide-and-seek was still going on, it took Edmundand Lucy some time to find the others. But when at last they were all together(which happened in the long room, where the suit of armour was) Lucy burstout:“Peter! Susan! It’s all true. Edmund has seen it too. There is a country youcan get to through the wardrobe. Edmund and I both got in. We met one anotherin there, in the wood. Go on, Edmund; tell them all about it.”“What’s all this about, Ed?” said Peter.And now we come to one of the nastiest things in this story. Up to thatmoment Edmund had been feeling sick, and sulky, and annoyed with Lucy forbeing right, but he hadn’t made up his mind what to do. When Peter suddenlyasked him the question he decided all at once to do the meanest and mostspiteful thing he could think of. He decided to let Lucy down.“Tell us, Ed,” said Susan.And Edmund gave a very superior look as if he were far older than Lucy(there was really only a year’s difference) and then a little snigger and said, “Oh,yes, Lucy and I have been playing - pretending that all her story about a countryin the wardrobe is true. just for fun, of course. There’s nothing there really.”Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room.Edmund, who was becoming a nastier person every minute, thought that hehad scored a great success, and went on at once to say, “There she goes again.What’s the matter with her? That’s the worst of young kids, they always -““Look here,” said Peter, turning on him savagely, “shut up! You’ve beenperfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe,and now you go playing games with her about it and setting her off again. Ibelieve you did it simply out of spite.”“But it’s all nonsense,” said Edmund, very taken aback.“Of course it’s all nonsense,” said Peter, “that’s just the point. Lu wasperfectly all right when we left home, but since we’ve been down here she seemsto be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar. Butwhichever it is, what good do you think you’ll do by jeering and nagging at herone day and encouraging her the next?”“I thought - I thought,” said Edmund; but he couldn’t think of anything tosay.“You didn’t think anything at all,” said Peter; “it’s just spite. You’ve alwaysliked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself; we’ve seen that at schoolbefore now.”“Do stop it,” said Susan; “it won’t make things any better having a rowbetween you two. Let’s go and find Lucy.”It was not surprising that when they found Lucy, a good deal later, everyonecould see that she had been crying. Nothing they could say to her made anydifference. She stuck to her story and said:“I don’t care what you think, and I don’t care what you say. You can tell theProfessor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like. I knowI’ve met a Faun in there and - I wish I’d stayed there and you are all beasts,beasts.”It was an unpleasant evening. Lucy was miserable and Edmund wasbeginning to feel that his plan wasn’t working as well as he had expected. Thetwo older ones were really beginning to think that Lucy was out of her mind.They stood in the passage talking about it in whispers long after she had gone tobed.The result was the next morning they decided that they really would go andtell the whole thing to the Professor. “He’ll write to Father if he thinks there isreally something wrong with Lu,” said Peter; “it’s getting beyond us.” So theywent and knocked at the study door, and the Professor said “Come in,” and gotup and found chairs for them and said he was quite at their disposal. Then he satlistening to them with the tips of his fingers pressed together and neverinterrupting, till they had finished the whole story. After that he said nothing forquite a long time. Then he cleared his throat and said the last thing either of themexpected:“How do you know,” he asked, “that your sister’s story is not true?”“Oh, but -” began Susan, and then stopped. Anyone could see from the oldman’s face that he was perfectly serious. Then Susan pulled herself together andsaid, “But Edmund said they had only been pretending.”“That is a point,” said the Professor, “which certainly deserves consideration;very careful consideration. For instance - if you will excuse me for asking thequestion - does your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister asthe more reliable? I mean, which is the more truthful?”“That’s just the funny thing about it, sir,” said Peter. “Up till now, I’d havesaid Lucy every time.”“And what do you think, my dear?” said the Professor, turning to Susan.“Well,” said Susan, “in general, I’d say the same as Peter, but this couldn’tbe true - all this about the wood and the Faun.”“That is more than I know,” said the Professor, “and a charge of lying againstsomeone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing; a veryserious thing indeed.”“We were afraid it mightn’t even be lying,” said Susan; “we thought theremight be something wrong with Lucy.”“Madness, you mean?” said the Professor quite coolly. “Oh, you can makeyour minds easy about that. One has only to look at her and talk to her to see thatshe is not mad.”“But then,” said Susan, and stopped. She had never dreamed that a grown-upwould talk like the Professor and didn’t know what to think.“Logic!” said the Professor half to himself. “Why don’t they teach logic atthese schools? There are only three possibilities. Either your sister is telling lies,or she is mad, or she is telling the truth. You know she doesn’t tell lies and it isobvious that she is not mad For the moment then and unless any further evidenceturns up, we must assume that she is telling the truth.”Susan looked at him very hard and was quite sure from the expression on hisface that he was no making fun of them.“But how could it be true, sir?” said Peter.“Why do you say that?” asked the Professor.“Well, for one thing,” said Peter, “if it was true why doesn’t everyone findthis country every time they go to the wardrobe? I mean, there was nothing therewhen we looked; even Lucy didn’t pretend the was.”“What has that to do with it?” said the Professor.“Well, sir, if things are real, they’re there all the time.”“Are they?” said the Professor; and Peter did’nt know quite what to say.“But there was no time,” said Susan. “Lucy had no time to have goneanywhere, even if there was such a place. She came running after us the verymoment we were out of the room. It was less than minute, and she pretended tohave been away for hours.”“That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true,” said theProfessor. “If there really a door in this house that leads to some other world(and I should warn you that this is a very strange house, and even I know verylittle about it) - if, I say, she had got into another world, I should not be at asurprised to find that the other world had a separate time of its own; so thathowever long you stay there it would never take up any of our time. On the otherhand, I don’t think many girls of her age would invent that idea for themselves.If she had been pretending, she would have hidden for a reasonable time beforecoming out and telling her story.”“But do you really mean, sir,” said Peter, “that there could be other worlds -all over the place, just round the corner - like that?”“Nothing is more probable,” said the Professor, taking off his spectacles andbeginning to polish them, while he muttered to himself, “I wonder what they doteach them at these schools.”“But what are we to do?” said Susan. She felt that the conversation wasbeginning to get off the point.“My dear young lady,” said the Professor, suddenly looking up with a verysharp expression at both of them, “there is one plan which no one has yetsuggested and which is well worth trying.”“What’s that?” said Susan.“We might all try minding our own business,” said he. And that was the endof that conversation.After this things were a good deal better for Lucy. Peter saw to it thatEdmund stopped jeering at her, and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined totalk about the wardrobe at all. It had become a rather alarming subject. And sofor a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end; but that wasnot to be.This house of the Professor’s - which even he knew so little about - was soold and famous that people from all over England used to come and askpermission to see over it. It was the sort of house that is mentioned in guidebooks and even in histories; and well it might be, for all manner of stories weretold about it, some of them even stranger than the one I am telling you now. Andwhen parties of sightseers arrived and asked to see the house, the Professoralways gave them permission, and Mrs Macready, the housekeeper, showedthem round, telling them about the pictures and the armour, and the rare books inthe library. Mrs Macready was not fond of children, and did not like to beinterrupted when she was telling visitors all the things she knew. She had said toSusan and Peter almost on the first morning (along with a good many otherinstructions), “And please remember you’re to keep out of the way wheneverI’m taking a party over the house.”“Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing roundwith a crowd of strange grown-ups!” said Edmund, and the other three thoughtthe same. That was how the adventures began for the second time.A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armourand wondering if they could take it to bits when the two girls rushed into theroom and said, “Look out! Here comes the Macready and a whole gang withher.”“Sharp’s the word,” said Peter, and all four made off through the door at thefar end of the room. But when they had got out into the Green Room and beyondit, into the Library, they suddenly heard voices ahead of them, and realized thatMrs Macready must be bringing her party of sightseers up the back stairs instead of up the front stairs as they had expected. And after that - whether it wasthat they lost their heads, or that Mrs Macready was trying to catch them, or thatsome magic in the house had come to life and was chasing them into Narnia theyseemed to find themselves being followed everywhere, until at last Susan said,“Oh bother those trippers! Here - let’s get into the Wardrobe Room till they’vepassed. No one will follow us in there.” But the moment they were inside theyheard the voices in the passage - and then someone fumbling at the door - andthen they saw the handle turning.“Quick!” said Peter, “there’s nowhere else,” and flung open the wardrobe.All four of them bundled inside it and sat there, panting, in the dark. Peter heldthe door closed but did not shut it; for, of course, he remembered, as everysensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up in awardrobe.Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER SIXINTO THE FOREST“I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away,” saidSusan presently, “I’m getting horribly cramped.”“And what a filthy smell of camphor!” said Edmund.“I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it,” said Susan, “to keep awaythe moths.”“There’s something sticking into my back,” said Peter.“And isn’t it cold?” said Susan.“Now that you mention it, it is cold,” said Peter, “and hang it all, it’s wet too.What’s the matter with this place? I’m sitting on something wet. It’s gettingwetter every minute.” He struggled to his feet.“Let’s get out,” said Edmund, “they’ve gone.”“O-o-oh!” said Susan suddenly, and everyone asked her what was the matter.“I’m sitting against a tree,” said Susan, “and look! It’s getting light - overthere.”“By Jove, you’re right,” said Peter, “and look there - and there. It’s trees allround. And this wet stuff is snow. Why, I do believe we’ve got into Lucy’s woodafter all.”And now there was no mistaking it and all four children stood blinking in thedaylight of a winter day. Behind them were coats hanging on pegs, in front ofthem were snow-covered trees.Peter turned at once to Lucy.“I apologize for not believing you,” he said, “I’m sorry. Will you shakehands?”“Of course,” said Lucy, and did.“And now,” said Susan, “what do we do next?”“Do?” said Peter, “why, go and explore the wood, of course.”“Ugh!” said Susan, stamping her feet, “it’s pretty cold. What about puttingon some of these coats?”“They’re not ours,” said Peter doubtfully.“I am sure nobody would mind,” said Susan; “it isn’t as if we wanted to takethem out of the house; we shan’t take them even out of the wardrobe.”“I never thought of that, Su,” said Peter. “Of course, now you put it that way,I see. No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in thewardrobe where you found it. And I suppose this whole country is in thewardrobe.”They immediately carried out Susan’s very sensible plan. The coats wererather too big for them so that they came down to their heels and looked morelike royal robes than coats when they had put them on. But they all felt a gooddeal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new get-up andmore suitable to the landscape.“We can pretend we are Arctic explorers,” said Lucy.“This is going to be exciting enough without pretending,” said Peter, as hebegan leading the way forward into the forest. There were heavy darkish cloudsoverhead and it looked as if there might be more snow before night.“I say,” began Edmund presently, “oughtn’t we to be bearing a bit more tothe left, that is, if we are aiming for the lamp-post?” He had forgotten for themoment that he must pretend never to have been in the wood before. Themoment the words were out of his mouth he realized that he had given himselfaway. Everyone stopped; everyone stared at him. Peter whistled.“So you really were here,” he said, “that time Lu said she’d met you in here and you made out she was telling lies.”There was a dead silence. “Well, of all the poisonous little beasts -” saidPeter, and shrugged his shoulders and said no more. There seemed, indeed, nomore to say, and presently the four resumed their journey; but Edmund wassaying to himself, “I’ll pay you all out for this, you pack of stuck-up,selfsatisfied prigs.”“Where are we going anyway?” said Susan, chiefly for the sake of changingthe subject.“I think Lu ought to be the leader,” said Peter; “goodness knows she deservesit. Where will you take us, Lu?”“What about going to see Mr Tumnus?” said Lucy. “He’s the nice Faun I toldyou about.”Everyone agreed to this and off they went walking briskly and stamping theirfeet. Lucy proved a good leader. At first she wondered whether she would beable to find the way, but she recognized an oddlooking tree on one place and astump in another and brought them on to where the ground became uneven andinto the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr Tumnus’s cave. But there aterrible surprise awaited them.The door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits. Inside, thecave was dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had notbeen lived in for several days. Snow had drifted in from the doorway and washeaped on the floor, mixed with something black, which turned out to be thecharred sticks and ashes from the fire. Someone had apparently flung it about theroom and then stamped it out. The crockery lay smashed on the floor and thepicture of the Faun’s father had been slashed into shreds with a knife.“This is a pretty good wash-out,” said Edmund; “not much good cominghere.”“What is this?” said Peter, stooping down. He had just noticed a piece ofpaper which had been nailed through the carpet to the floor.“Is there anything written on it?” asked Susan.“Yes, I think there is,” answered Peter, “but I can’t read it in this light. Let’sget out into the open air.”They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter as he read out thefollowing words:The former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest andawaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her Imperial MajestyJadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands,etc., also of comforting her said Majesty’s enemies, harbouring spies andfraternizing with Humans.signed MAUGRIM, Captain of the Secret Police, LONG LIVE THEQUEENThe children stared at each other.“I don’t know that I’m going to like this place after all,” said Susan.“Who is this Queen, Lu?” said Peter. “Do you know anything about her?”“She isn’t a real queen at all,” answered Lucy; “she’s a horrible witch, theWhite Witch. Everyone all the wood people - hate her. She has made anenchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and neverChristmas.”“I - I wonder if there’s any point in going on,” said Susan. “I mean, it doesn’tseem particularly safe here and it looks as if it won’t be much fun either. And it’sgetting colder every minute, and we’ve brought nothing to eat. What about justgoing home?”“Oh, but we can’t, we can’t,” said Lucy suddenly; “don’t you see? We can’tjust go home, not after this. It is all on my account that the poor Faun has gotinto this trouble. He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back. That’swhat it means by comforting the Queen’s enemies and fraternizing with Humans.We simply must try to rescue him.”“A lot we could do! said Edmund, “when we haven’t even got anything toeat!”“Shut up - you!” said Peter, who was still very angry with Edmund. “Whatdo you think, Susan?”“I’ve a horrid feeling that Lu is right,” said Susan. “I don’t want to go a stepfurther and I wish we’d never come. But I think we must try to do something forMr Whatever-his-name is - I mean the Faun.”“That’s what I feel too,” said Peter. “I’m worried about having no food withus. I’d vote for going back and getting something from the larder, only theredoesn’t seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when onceyou’ve got out of it. I think we’ll have to go on.”“So do I,” said both the girls.“If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned!” said Peter.They were all still wondering what to do next, when Lucy said, “Look!There’s a robin, with such a red breast. It’s the first bird I’ve seen here. I say! - Iwonder can birds talk in Narnia? It almost looks as if it wanted to say somethingto us.” Then she turned to the Robin and said, “Please, can you tell us whereTumnus the Faun has been taken to?” As she said this she took a step towardsthe bird. It at once flew away but only as far as to the next tree. There it perchedand looked at them very hard as if it understood all they had been saying. Almostwithout noticing that they had done so, the four children went a step or twonearer to it. At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once morelooked at them very hard. (You couldn’t have found a robin with a redder chestor a brighter eye.)“Do you know,” said Lucy, “I really believe he means us to follow him.”“I’ve an idea he does,” said Susan. “What do you think, Peter?”“Well, we might as well try it,” answered Peter.The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly. It kept going fromtree to tree, always a few yards ahead of them, but always so near that they couldeasily follow it. In this way it led them on, slightly downhill. Wherever theRobin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch. Presently theclouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all aroundthem grew dazzlingly bright. They had been travelling in this way for about halfan hour, with the two girls in front, when Edmund said to Peter, “if you’re notstill too high and mighty to talk to me, I’ve something to say which you’d betterlisten to.”“What is it?” asked Peter.“Hush! Not so loud,” said Edmund; “there’s no good frightening the girls.But have you realized what we’re doing?”“What?” said Peter, lowering his voice to a whisper.“We’re following a guide we know nothing about. How do we know whichside that bird is on? Why shouldn’t it be leading us into a trap?”“That’s a nasty idea. Still - a robin, you know. They’re good birds in all thestories I’ve ever read. I’m sure a robin wouldn’t be on the wrong side.”“It if comes to that, which is the right side? How do we know that the Faunsare in the right and the Queen (yes, I know we’ve been told she’s a witch) is inthe wrong? We don’t really know anything about either.”“The Faun saved Lucy.”“He said he did. But how do we know? And there’s another thing too. Hasanyone the least idea of the way home from here?”“Great Scott!” said Peter, “I hadn’t thought of that.”“And no chance of dinner either,” said Edmund.Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER SEVENA DAY WITH THE BEAVERSWHILE the two boys were whispering behind, both the girls suddenly cried“Oh!” and stopped.“The robin!” cried Lucy, “the robin. It’s flown away.” And so it had - rightout of sight.“And now what are we to do?” said Edmund, giving Peter a look which wasas much as to say “What did I tell you?”“Sh! Look!” said Susan.“What?” said Peter.“There’s something moving among the trees over there to the left.”They all stared as hard as they could, and no one felt very comfortable.“There it goes again,” said Susan presently.“I saw it that time too,” said Peter. “It’s still there. It’s just gone behind thatbig tree.”“What is it?” asked Lucy, trying very hard not to sound nervous.“Whatever it is,” said Peter, “it’s dodging us. It’s something that doesn’twant to be seen.”“Let’s go home,” said Susan. And then, though nobody said it out loud,everyone suddenly realized the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter atthe end of the last chapter. They were lost.“What’s it like?” said Lucy.“It’s - it’s a kind of animal,” said Susan; and then, “Look! Look! Quick!There it is.”They all saw it this time, a whiskered furry face which had looked out atthem from behind a tree. But this time it didn’t immediately draw back. Instead,the animal put its paw against its mouth just as humans put their finger on theirlips when they are signalling to you to be quiet. Then it disappeared again. Thechildren, all stood holding their breath.A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree, glanced all roundas if it were afraid someone was watching, said “Hush”, made signs to them tojoin it in the thicker bit of wood where it was standing, and then once moredisappeared.“I know what it is,” said Peter; “it’s a beaver. I saw the tail.”“It wants us to go to it,” said Susan, “and it is warning us not to make anoise.”“I know,” said Peter. “The question is, are we to go to it or not? What do youthink, Lu?”“I think it’s a nice beaver,” said Lucy.“Yes, but how do we know?” said Edmund.“Shan’t we have to risk it?” said Susan. “I mean, it’s no good just standinghere and I feel I want some dinner.”At this moment the Beaver again popped its head out from behind the treeand beckoned earnestly to them.“Come on,” said Peter,”let’s give it a try. All keep close together. We oughtto be a match for one beaver if it turns out to be an enemy.”So the children all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behindit, and there, sure enough, they found the Beaver; but it still drew back, saying tothem in a hoarse throaty whisper, “Further in, come further in. Right in here.We’re not safe in the open!”Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four trees grew so closetogether that their boughs met and the brown earth and pine needles could beseen underfoot because no snow had been able to fall there, did it begin to talk tothem.“Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve?” it said.“We’re some of them,” said Peter.“S-s-s-sh!” said the Beaver, “not so loud please. We’re not safe even here.”“Why, who are you afraid of?” said Peter. “There’s no one here butourselves.”“There are the trees,” said the Beaver. “They’re always listening. Most ofthem are on our side, but there are trees that would betray us to her; you knowwho I mean,” and it nodded its head several times.“If it comes to talking about sides,” said Edmund, “how do we know you’rea friend?”“Not meaning to be rude, Mr Beaver,” added Peter, “but you see, we’restrangers.”“Quite right, quite right,” said the Beaver. “Here is my token.” With thesewords it held up to them a little white object. They all looked at it in surprise, tillsuddenly Lucy said, “Oh, of course. It’s my handkerchief - the one I gave to poorMr Tumnus.”“That’s right,” said the Beaver. “Poor fellow, he got wind of the arrest beforeit actually happened and handed this over to me. He said that if anythinghappened to him I must meet you here and take you on to -” Here the Beaver’svoice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious nods. Thensignalling to the children to stand as close around it as they possibly could, sothat their faces were actually tickled by its whiskers, it added in a low whisper “They say Aslan is on the move - perhaps has already landed.”And now a very curious thing happened. None of the children knew whoAslan was any more than you do; but the moment the Beaver had spoken thesewords everyone felt quite different. Perhaps it has sometimes happened to you ina dream that someone says something which you don’t understand but in thedream it feels as if it had some enormous meaning - either a terrifying one whichturns the whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely toput into words, which makes the dream so beautiful that you remember it allyour life and are always wishing you could get into that dream again. It was likethat now. At the name of Aslan each one of the children felt something jump inits inside. Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror. Peter felt suddenlybrave and adventurous. Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightfulstrain of music had just floated by her. And Lucy got the feeling you have whenyou wake up in the morning and realize that it is the beginning of the holidays orthe beginning of summer.“And what about Mr Tumnus,” said Lucy; “where is he?”“S-s-s-sh,” said the Beaver, “not here. I must bring you where we can have areal talk and also dinner.”No one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the beaver now, andeveryone, including Edmund, was very glad to hear the word “dinner”.They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at asurprisingly quick pace, and always in the thickest parts of the forest, for over anhour. Everyone was feeling very tired and very hungry when suddenly the treesbegan to get thinner in front of them and the ground to fall steeply downhill. Aminute later they came out under the open sky (the sun was still shining) andfound themselves looking down on a fine sight.They were standing on the edge of a steep, narrow valley at the bottom ofwhich ran - at least it would have been running if it hadn’t been frozen - a fairlylarge river. Just below them a dam had been built across this river, and whenthey saw it everyone suddenly remembered that of course beavers are alwaysmaking dams and felt quite sure that Mr Beaver had made this one. They alsonoticed that he now had a sort of modest expression on his, face - the sort of lookpeople have when you are visiting a garden they’ve made or reading a storythey’ve written. So it was only common politeness when Susan said, “What alovely dam!” And Mr Beaver didn’t say “Hush” this time but “Merely a trifle!Merely a trifle! And it isn’t really finished!”Above the dam there was what ought to have been a deep pool but was now,of course, a level floor of dark green ice. And below the dam, much lower down,was more ice, but instead of being smooth this was all frozen into the foamy andwavy shapes in which the water had been rushing along at the very momentwhen the frost came. And where the water had been trickling over and spurtingthrough the dam there was now a glittering wall of icicles, as if the side of thedam had been covered all over with flowers and wreaths and festoons of thepurest sugar. And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funnylittle house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roofsmoke was going up, so that when you saw it {especially if you were hungry)you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.That was what the others chiefly noticed, but Edmund noticed somethingelse. A little lower down the river there was another small river which camedown another small valley to join it. And looking up that valley, Edmund couldsee two small hills, and he was almost sure they were the two hills which theWhite Witch had pointed out to him when he parted from her at the lamp-postthat other day. And then between them, he thought, must be her palace, only amile off or less. And he thought about Turkish Delight and about being a King(”And I wonder how Peter will like that?” he asked himself) and horrible ideascame into his head.“Here we are,” said Mr Beaver, “and it looks as if Mrs Beaver is expectingus. I’ll lead the way. But be careful and don’t slip.”The top of the dam was wide enough to walk on, though not (for humans) avery nice place to walk because it was covered with ice, and though the frozenpool was level with it on one side, there was a nasty drop to the lower river onthe other. Along this route Mr Beaver led them in single file right out to themiddle where they could look a long way up the river and a long way down it.And when they had reached the middle they were at the door of the house.“Here we are, Mrs Beaver,” said Mr Beaver, “I’ve found them. Here are theSons and Daughters of Adam and Eve’- and they all went in.The first thing Lucy noticed as she went in was a burring sound, and the firstthing she saw was a kindlooking old she-beaver sitting in the corner with athread in her mouth working busily at her sewing machine, and it was from itthat the sound came. She stopped her work and got up as soon as the childrencame in.“So you’ve come at last!” she said, holding out both her wrinkled old paws.“At last! To think that ever I should live to see this day! The potatoes are onboiling and the kettle’s singing and I daresay, Mr Beaver, you’ll get us somefish.”“That I will,” said Mr Beaver, and he went out of the house (Peter went withhim), and across the ice of the deep pool to where he had a little hole in the icewhich he kept open every day with his hatchet. They took a pail with them. MrBeaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole (he didn’t seem to mind it beingso chilly), looked hard into it, then suddenly shot in his paw, and before youcould say Jack Robinson had whisked out a beautiful trout. Then he did it allover again until they had a fine catch of fish.Meanwhile the girls were helping Mrs Beaver to fill the kettle and lay thetable and cut the bread and put the plates in the oven to heat and draw a huge jugof beer for Mr Beaver from a barrel which stood in one corner of the house, andto put on the frying-pan and get the dripping hot. Lucy thought the Beavers had avery snug little home though it was not at all like Mr Tumnus’s cave. There wereno books or pictures, and instead of beds there were bunks, like on board ship,built into the wall. And there were hams and strings of onions hanging from theroof, and against the walls were gum boots and oilskins and hatchets and pairs ofshears and spades and trowels and things for carrying mortar in and fishing-rodsand fishing-nets and sacks. And the cloth on the table, though very clean, wasvery rough.Just as the frying-pan was nicely hissing Peter and Mr Beaver came in withthe fish which Mr Beaver had already opened with his knife and cleaned out inthe open air. You can think how good the new-caught fish smelled while theywere frying and how the hungry children longed for them to be done and howvery much hungrier still they had become before Mr Beaver said, “Now we’renearly ready.” Susan drained the potatoes and then put them all back in theempty pot to dry on the side of the range while Lucy was helping Mrs Beaver todish up the trout, so that in a very few minutes everyone was drawing up theirstools (it was all three-legged stools in the Beavers’ house except for MrsBeaver’s own special rockingchair beside the fire) and preparing to enjoythemselves. There was a jug of creamy milk for the children (Mr Beaver stuck tobeer) and a great big lump of deep yellow butter in the middle of the table fromwhich everyone took as much as he wanted to go with his potatoes, and all thechildren thought - and I agree with them - that there’s nothing to beat goodfreshwater fish if you eat it when it has been alive half an hour ago and has comeout of the pan half a minute ago. And when they had finished the fish MrsBeaver brought unexpectedly out of the oven a great and gloriously stickymarmalade roll, steaming hot, and at the same time moved the kettle on to thefire, so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea was made andready to be poured out. And when each person had got his (or her) cup of tea,each person shoved back his (or her) stool so as to be able to lean against thewall and gave a long sigh of contentment.“And now,” said Mr Beaver, pushing away his empty beer mug and pullinghis cup of tea towards him, “if you’ll just wait till I’ve got my pipe lit up andgoing nicely - why, now we can get to business. It’s snowing again,” he added,cocking his eye at the window. “That’s all the better, because it means we shan’thave any visitors; and if anyone should have been trying to follow you, why hewon’t find any tracks.”Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER EIGHTWHAT HAPPENED AFTER DINNER“AND now,” said Lucy, “do please tell us what’s happened to Mr Tumnus.”“Ah, that’s bad,” said Mr Beaver, shaking his head. “That’s a very, very badbusiness. There’s no doubt he was taken off by the police. I got that from a birdwho saw it done.”“But where’s he been taken to?” asked Lucy.“Well, they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we allknow what that means.”“No, we don’t,” said Susan. Mr Beaver shook his head in a very gloomyfashion.“I’m afraid it means they were taking him to her House,” he said.“But what’ll they do to him, Mr Beaver?” gasped Lucy.“Well,” said Mr Beaver, “you can’t exactly say for sure. But there’s not manytaken in there that ever comes out again. Statues. All full of statues they say it is- in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the hall. People she’s turned” - (hepaused and shuddered) “turned into stone.”“But, Mr Beaver,” said Lucy, “can’t we - I mean we must do something tosave him. It’s too dreadful and it’s all on my account.”“I don’t doubt you’d save him if you could, dearie,” said Mrs Beaver, “butyou’ve no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming outalive.”“Couldn’t we have some stratagem?” said Peter. “I mean couldn’t we dressup as something, or pretend to be - oh, pedlars or anything - or watch till she wasgone out - or- oh, hang it all, there must be some way. This Faun saved my sisterat his own risk, Mr Beaver. We can’t just leave him to be - to be - to have thatdone to him.”“It’s no good, Son of Adam,” said Mr Beaver, “no good your trying, of allpeople. But now that Aslan is on the move-““Oh, yes! Tell us about Aslan!” said several voices at once; for once againthat strange feeling - like the first signs of spring, like good news, had come overthem.“Who is Aslan?” asked Susan.“Aslan?” said Mr Beaver. “Why, don’t you know? He’s the King. He’s theLord of the whole wood, but not often here, you understand. Never in my time ormy father’s time. But the word has reached us that he has come back. He is inNarnia at this moment. He’ll settle the White Queen all right. It is he, not you,that will save Mr Tumnus.”“She won’t turn him into stone too?” said Edmund.“Lord love you, Son of Adam, what a simple thing to say!” answered MrBeaver with a great laugh. “Turn him into stone? If she can stand on her two feetand look him in the face it’ll be the most she can do and more than I expect ofher. No, no. He’ll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in these parts:Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.You’ll understand when you see him.”“But shall we see him?” asked Susan.“Why, Daughter of Eve, that’s what I brought you here for. I’m to lead youwhere you shall meet him,” said Mr Beaver.“Is-is he a man?” asked Lucy.“Aslan a man!” said Mr Beaver sternly. “Certainly not. I tell you he is theKing of the wood and the son of the great Emperor-beyond-the-Sea. Don’t youknow who is the King of Beasts? Aslan is a lion - the Lion, the great Lion.”“Ooh!” said Susan, “I’d thought he was a man. Is he - quite safe? I shall feelrather nervous about meeting a lion.”“That you will, dearie, and no mistake,” said Mrs Beaver; “if there’s anyonewho can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they’re either braverthan most or else just silly.”“Then he isn’t safe?” said Lucy.“Safe?” said Mr Beaver; “don’t you hear what Mrs Beaver tells you? Whosaid anything about safe? ‘Course he isn’t safe. But he’s good. He’s the King, Itell you.”“I’m longing to see him,” said Peter, “even if I do feel frightened when itcomes to the point.”“That’s right, Son of Adam,” said Mr Beaver, bringing his paw down on thetable with a crash that made all the cups and saucers rattle. “And so you shall.Word has been sent that you are to meet him, tomorrow if you can, at the StoneTable.’“Where’s that?” said Lucy.“I’ll show you,” said Mr Beaver. “It’s down the river, a good step from here.I’ll take you to it!”“But meanwhile what about poor Mr Tumnus?” said Lucy.“The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan,” said MrBeaver, “once he’s with us, then we can begin doing things. Not that we don’tneed you too. For that’s another of the old rhymes:When Adam’s flesh and Adam’s boneSits at Cair Paravel in throne,The evil time will be over and done.So things must be drawing near their end now he’s come and you’ve come.We’ve heard of Aslan coming into these parts before - long ago, nobody can saywhen. But there’s never been any of your race here before.”“That’s what I don’t understand, Mr Beaver,” said Peter, “I mean isn’t theWitch herself human?”“She’d like us to believe it,” said Mr Beaver, “and it’s on that that she basesher claim to be Queen. But she’s no Daughter of Eve. She comes of your fatherAdam’s” - (here Mr Beaver bowed) “your father Adam’s first wife, her theycalled Lilith. And she was one of the Jinn. That’s what she comes from on oneside. And on the other she comes of the giants. No, no, there isn’t a drop of realhuman blood in the Witch.”“That’s why she’s bad all through, Mr Beaver,” said Mrs Beaver.“True enough, Mrs Beaver,” replied he, “there may be two views abouthumans (meaning no offence to the present company). But there’s no two viewsabout things that look like humans and aren’t.”“I’ve known good Dwarfs,” said Mrs Beaver.“So’ve I, now you come to speak of it,” said her husband, “but precious few,and they were the ones least like men. But in general, take my advice, when youmeet anything that’s going to be human and isn’t yet, or used to be human onceand isn’t now, or ought to be human and isn’t, you keep your eyes on it and feelfor your hatchet. And that’s why the Witch is always on the lookout for anyhumans in Narnia. She’s been watching for you this many a year, and if sheknew there were four of you she’d be more dangerous still.”“What’s that to do with it?” asked Peter.“Because of another prophecy,” said Mr Beaver. “Down at Cair Paravel that’s the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought tobe the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be - down at CairParavel there are four thrones and it’s a saying in Narnia time out of mind thatwhen two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones, thenit will be the end not only of the White Witch’s reign but of her life, and that iswhy we had to be so cautious as we came along, for if she knew about you four,your lives wouldn’t be worth a shake of my whiskers!”All the children had been attending so hard to what Mr Beaver was tellingthem that they had noticed nothing else for a long time. Then during the momentof silence that followed his last remark, Lucy suddenly said:“I say-where’s Edmund?”There was a dreadful pause, and then everyone began asking “Who saw himlast? How long has he been missing? Is he outside? and then all rushed to thedoor and looked out. The snow was falling thickly and steadily, the green ice ofthe pool had vanished under a thick white blanket, and from where the littlehouse stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank. Out theywent, plunging well over their ankles into the soft new snow, and went round thehouse in every direction. “Edmund! Edmund!” they called till they were hoarse.But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle their voices and there was noteven an echo in answer.“How perfectly dreadful!” said Susan as they at last came back in despair.“Oh, how I wish we’d never come.”“What on earth are we to do, Mr Beaver?” said Peter.“Do?” said Mr Beaver, who was already putting on his snow-boots, “do? Wemust be off at once. We haven’t a moment to spare!”“We’d better divide into four search parties,” said Peter, “and all go indifferent directions. Whoever finds him must come back here at once and-““Search parties, Son of Adam?” said Mr Beaver; “what for?”“Why, to look for Edmund, of course!”“There’s no point in looking for him,” said Mr Beaver.“What do you mean?” said Susan. “He can’t be far away yet. And we’ve gotto find him. What do you mean when you say there’s no use looking for him?”“The reason there’s no use looking,” said Mr Beaver, “is that we knowalready where he’s gone!” Everyone stared in amazement. “Don’t youunderstand?” said Mr Beaver. “He’s gone to her, to the White Witch. He hasbetrayed us all.”“Oh, surely-oh, really!” said Susan, “he can’t have done that.”“Can’t he?” said Mr Beaver, looking very hard at the three children, andeverything they wanted to say died on their lips, for each felt suddenly quitecertain inside that this was exactly what Edmund had done.“But will he know the way?” said Peter.“Has he been in this country before?” asked Mr Beaver. “Has he ever beenhere alone?”“Yes,” said Lucy, almost in a whisper. “I’m afraid he has.”“And did he tell you what he’d done or who he’d met?”“Well, no, he didn’t,” said Lucy.“Then mark my words,” said Mr Beaver, “he has already met the WhiteWitch and joined her side, and been told where she lives. I didn’t like to mentionit before (he being your brother and all) but the moment I set eyes on that brotherof yours I said to myself `Treacherous’. He had the look of one who has beenwith the Witch and eaten her food. You can always tell them if you’ve lived longin Narnia; something about their eyes.”“All the same,” said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice, “we’ll still haveto go and look for him. He is our brother after all, even if he is rather a littlebeast. And he’s only a kid.”“Go to the Witch’s House?” said Mrs Beaver. “Don’t you see that the onlychance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her?”“How do you mean?” said Lucy.“Why, all she wants is to get all four of you (she’s thinking all the time ofthose four thrones at Cair Paravel). Once you were all four inside her House herjob would be done - and there’d be four new statues in her collection beforeyou’d had time to speak. But she’ll keep him alive as long as he’s the only oneshe’s got, because she’ll want to use him as a decoy; as bait to catch the rest ofyou with.”“Oh, can no one help us?” wailed Lucy.“Only Aslan,” said Mr Beaver, “we must go on and meet him. That’s ouronly chance now.”“It seems to me, my dears,” said Mrs Beaver, “that it is very important toknow just when he slipped away. How much he can tell her depends on howmuch he heard. For instance, had we started talking of Aslan before he left? Ifnot, then we may do very well, for she won’t know that Aslan has come toNarnia, or that we are meeting him, and will be quite off her guard as far as thatis concerned.”“I don’t remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan -”began Peter, but Lucy interrupted him.“Oh yes, he was,” she said miserably; “don’t you remember, it was he whoasked whether the Witch couldn’t turn Aslan into stone too?”“So he did, by Jove,” said Peter; “just the sort of thing he would say, too!”“Worse and worse,” said Mr Beaver, “and the next thing is this. Was he stillhere when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table?”And of course no one knew the answer to this question.“Because, if he was,” continued Mr Beaver, “then she’ll simply sledge downin that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our waydown. In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan. ““But that isn’t what she’ll do first,” said Mrs Beaver, “not if I know her. Themoment that Edmund tells her that we’re all here she’ll set out to catch us thisvery night, and if he’s been gone about half an hour, she’ll be here in aboutanother twenty minutes.”“You’re right, Mrs Beaver,” said her husband, “we must all get away fromhere. There’s not a moment to lose.”Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER NINEIN THE WITCH’S HOUSEAND now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund. Hehad eaten his share of the dinner, but he hadn’t really enjoyed it because he wasthinking all the time about Turkish Delight - and there’s nothing that spoils thetaste of good ordinary food half so much as the memory of bad magic food. Andhe had heard the conversation, and hadn’t enjoyed it much either, because hekept on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him and trying to givehim the cold shoulder. They weren’t, but he imagined it. And then he hadlistened until Mr Beaver told them about Aslan and until he had heard the wholearrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table. It was then that he began veryquietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door. For themention of Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave theothers a mysterious and lovely feeling.Just as Mr Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam’s flesh andAdam’s bone Edmund had been very quietly turning the doorhandle; and justbefore Mr Beaver had begun telling them that the White Witch wasn’t reallyhuman at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess, Edmund had got outside into thesnow and cautiously closed the door behind him.You mustn’t think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he actuallywanted his brother and sisters to be turned into stone. He did want TurkishDelight and to be a Prince (and later a King) and to pay Peter out for calling hima beast. As for what the Witch would do with the others, he didn’t want her to beparticularly nice to them - certainly not to put them on the same level as himself;but he managed to believe, or to pretend he believed, that she wouldn’t doanything very bad to them, “Because,” he said to himself, “all these people whosay nasty things about her are her enemies and probably half of it isn’t true. Shewas jolly nice to me, anyway, much nicer than they are. I expect she is therightful Queen really. Anyway, she’ll be better than that awful Aslan!” At least,that was the excuse he made in his own mind for what he was doing. It wasn’t avery good excuse, however, for deep down inside him he really knew that theWhite Witch was bad and cruel.The first thing he realized when he got outside and found the snow falling allround him, was that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers’ house. And ofcourse there was no chance of going back to get it now. The next thing herealized was that the daylight was almost gone, for it had been nearly threeo’clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were short. He hadn’treckoned on this; but he had to make the best of it. So he turned up his collar andshuffled across the top of the dam (luckily it wasn’t so slippery since the snowhad fallen) to the far side of the river.It was pretty bad when he reached the far side. It was growing darker everyminute and what with that and the snowflakes swirling all round him he couldhardly see three feet ahead. And then too there was no road. He kept slippinginto deep drifts of snow, and skidding on frozen puddles, and tripping over fallentree-trunks, and sliding down steep banks, and barking his shins against rocks,till he was wet and cold and bruised all over. The silence and the loneliness weredreadful. In fact I really think he might have given up the whole plan and goneback and owned up and made friends with the others, if he hadn’t happened tosay to himself, “When I’m King of Narnia the first thing I shall do will be tomake some decent roads.” And of course that set him off thinking about being aKing and all the other things he would do and this cheered him up a good deal.He had just settled in his mind what sort of palace he would have and how manycars and all about his private cinema and where the principal railways would runand what laws he would make against beavers and dams and was putting thefinishing touches to some schemes for keeping Peter in his place, when theweather changed. First the snow stopped. Then a wind sprang up and it becamefreezing cold. Finally, the clouds rolled away and the moon came out. It was afull moon and, shining on all that snow, it made everything almost as bright asday - only the shadows were rather confusing.He would never have found his way if the moon hadn’t come out by the timehe got to the other river you remember he had seen (when they first arrived at theBeavers’) a smaller river flowing into the great one lower down. He now reachedthis and turned to follow it up. But the little valley down which it came wasmuch steeper and rockier than the one he had just left and much overgrown withbushes, so that he could not have managed it at all in the dark. Even as it was, hegot wet through for he had to stoop under branches and great loads of snowcame sliding off on to his back. And every time this happened he thought moreand more how he hated Peter - just as if all this had been Peter’s fault.But at last he came to a part where it was more level and the valley openedout. And there, on the other side of the river, quite close to him, in the middle ofa little plain between two hills, he saw what must be the White Witch’s House.And the moon was shining brighter than ever. The House was really a smallcastle. It seemed to be all towers; little towers with long pointed spires on them,sharp as needles. They looked like huge dunce’s caps or sorcerer’s caps. Andthey shone in the moonlight and their long shadows looked strange on the snow.Edmund began to be afraid of the House.But it was too late to think of turning back now.He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the House. There wasnothing stirring; not the slightest sound anywhere. Even his own feet made nonoise on the deep newly fallen snow. He walked on and on, past corner aftercorner of the House, and past turret after turret to find the door. He had to goright round to the far side before he found it. It was a huge arch but the great irongates stood wide open.Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard, and therehe saw a sight that nearly made his heart stop beating. Just inside the gate, withthe moonlight shining on it, stood an enormous lion crouched as if it was readyto spring. And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch, afraid to go on andafraid to go back, with his knees knocking together. He stood there so long thathis teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not beenchattering with fear. How long this really lasted I don’t know, but it seemed toEdmund to last for hours.Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so still - for ithadn’t moved one inch since he first set eyes on it. Edmund now ventured a littlenearer, still keeping in the shadow of the arch as much as he could. He now sawfrom the way the lion was standing that it couldn’t have been looking at him atall. (”But supposing it turns its head?” thought Edmund.) In fact it was staring atsomething else namely a little: dwarf who stood with his back to it about fourfeet away. “Aha!” thought Edmund. “When it springs at the dwarf then will bemy chance to escape.” But still the lion never moved, nor did the dwarf. Andnow at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about the White Witchturning people into stone. Perhaps this was only a stone lion. And as soon as hehad thought of that he noticed that the lion’s back and the top of its head werecovered with snow. Of course it must be only a statue! No living animal wouldhave let itself get covered with snow. Then very slowly and with his heartbeating as if it would burst, Edmund ventured to go up to the lion. Even now hehardly dared to touch it, but at last he put out his hand, very quickly, and did. Itwas cold stone. He had been frightened of a mere statue!The relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold hesuddenly got warm all over right down to his toes, and at the same time therecame into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely idea. “Probably,” he thought,“this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about. She’s caught himalready and turned him into stone. So that’s the end of all their fine ideas abouthim! Pooh! Who’s afraid of Aslan?”And he stood there gloating over the stone lion, and presently he didsomething very silly and childish. He took a stump of lead pencil out of hispocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion’s upper lip and then a pair ofspectacles on its eyes. Then he said, “Yah! Silly old Aslan! How do you likebeing a stone? You thought yourself mighty fine, didn’t you?” But in spite of thescribbles on it the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible, and sad,and noble, staring up in the moonlight, that Edmund didn’t really get any fun outof jeering at it. He turned away and began to cross the courtyard.As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozens of statues allabout - standing here and there rather as the pieces stand on a chess-board whenit is half-way through the game. There were stone satyrs, and stone wolves, andbears and foxes and cat-amountains of stone. There were lovely stone shapesthat looked like women but who were really the spirits of trees. There was thegreat shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature thatEdmund took to be a dragon. They all looked so strange standing there perfectlylife-like and also perfectly still, in the bright cold moonlight, that it was eeriework crossing the courtyard. Right in the very middle stood a huge shape like aman, but as tall as a tree, with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great clubin its right hand. Even though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not alive one, Edmund did not like going past it.He now saw that there was a dim light showing from a doorway on the farside of the courtyard. He went to it; there was a flight of stone steps going up toan open door. Edmund went up them. Across the threshold lay a great wolf.“It’s all right, it’s all right,” he kept saying to himself; “it’s only a stone wolf.It can’t hurt me”, and he raised his leg to step over it. Instantly the huge creaturerose, with all the hair bristling along its back, opened a great, red mouth and saidin a growling voice:“Who’s there? Who’s there? Stand still, stranger, and tell me who you are.”“If you please, sir,” said Edmund, trembling so that he could hardly speak,“my name is Edmund, and I’m the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in thewood the other day and I’ve come to bring her the news that my brother andsisters are now in Narnia - quite close, in the Beavers’ house. She - she wanted tosee them.”“I will tell Her Majesty,” said the Wolf. “Meanwhile, stand still on thethreshold, as you value your life.” Then it vanished into the house.Edmund stood and waited, his fingers aching with cold and his heartpounding in his chest, and presently the grey wolf, Maugrim, the Chief of theWitch’s Secret Police, came bounding back and said, “Come in! Come in!Fortunate favourite of the Queen - or else not so fortunate.”And Edmund went in, taking great care not to tread on the Wolf’s paws.He found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillars, full, as thecourtyard had been, of statues. The one nearest the door was a little faun with avery sad expression on its face, and Edmund couldn’t help wondering if thismight be Lucy’s friend. The only light came from a single lamp and close besidethis sat the White Witch.“I’m come, your Majesty,” said Edmund, rushing eagerly forward.“How dare you come alone?” said the Witch in a terrible voice. “Did I nottell you to bring the others with you?”“Please, your Majesty,” said Edmund, “I’ve done the best I can. I’ve broughtthem quite close. They’re in the little house on top of the dam just up theriverwith Mr and Mrs Beaver.”A slow cruel smile came over the Witch’s face.“Is this all your news?” she asked.“No, your Majesty,” said Edmund, and proceeded to tell her all he had heardbefore leaving the Beavers’ house.“What! Aslan?” cried the Queen, “Aslan! Is this true? If I find you have liedto me -““Please, I’m only repeating what they said,” stammered Edmund.But the Queen, who was no longer attending to him, clapped her hands.Instantly the same dwarf whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared.“Make ready our sledge,” ordered the Witch, “and use the harness withoutbells.”Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER TENTHE SPELL BEGINS TO BREAKNow we must go back to Mr and Mrs Beaver and the three other children. Assoon as Mr Beaver said, “There’s no time to lose,” everyone began bundlingthemselves into coats, except Mrs Beaver, who started picking up sacks andlaying them on the table and said: “Now, Mr Beaver, just reach down that ham.And here’s a packet of tea, and there’s sugar, and some matches. And if someonewill get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner.”“What are you doing, Mrs Beaver?” exclaimed Susan.“Packing a load for each of us, dearie,” said Mrs Beaver very coolly. “Youdidn’t think we’d set out on a journey with nothing to eat, did you?”“But we haven’t time!” said Susan, buttoning the collar of her coat. “Shemay be here any minute.”“That’s what I say,” chimed in Mr Beaver.“Get along with you all,” said his wife. “Think it over, Mr Beaver. She can’tbe here for quarter of an hour at least.”“But don’t we want as big a start as we can possibly get,” said Peter, “ifwe’re to reach the Stone Table before her?”“You’ve got to remember that, Mrs Beaver,” said Susan. “As soon as she haslooked in here and finds we’re gone she’ll be off at top speed.”“That she will,” said Mrs Beaver. “But we can’t get there before herwhatever we do, for she’ll be on a sledge and we’ll be walking.”“Then - have we no hope?” said Susan.“Now don’t you get fussing, there’s a dear,” said Mrs Beaver, “but just gethalf a dozen clean handkerchiefs out of the drawer. ‘Course we’ve got a hope.We can’t get there before her but we can keep under cover and go by ways shewon’t expect and perhaps we’ll get through.”“That’s true enough, Mrs Beaver,” said her husband. “But it’s time we wereout of this.”“And don’t you start fussing either, Mr Beaver,” said his wife. “There. That’sbetter. There’s five loads and the smallest for the smallest of us: that’s you, mydear,” she added, looking at Lucy.“Oh, do please come on,” said Lucy.“Well, I’m nearly ready now,” answered Mrs Beaver at last, allowing herhusband to help her into; her snow-boots. “I suppose the sewing machine’s tookheavy to bring?”“Yes. It is,” said Mr Beaver. “A great deal too heavy. And you don’t thinkyou’ll be able to use it while we’re on the run, I suppose?”“I can’t abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it,” said Mrs Beaver,“and breaking it or stealing it, as likely as not.”“Oh, please, please, please, do hurry!” said the three children. And so at lastthey all got outside and Mr Beaver locked the door (”It’ll delay her a bit,” hesaid) and they set off, all carrying their loads over their shoulders.The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began theirjourney. They went in single file - first Mr Beaver, then Lucy, then Peter, thenSusan, and Mrs Beaver last of all. Mr Beaver led them across the dam and on tothe right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path among thetrees right down by the river-bank. The sides of the valley, shining in themoonlight, towered up far above them on either hand. “Best keep down here asmuch as possible,” he said. “She’ll have to keep to the top, for you couldn’tbring a sledge down here.”It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a windowfrom a comfortable armchair; and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at first.But as they went on walking and walking - and walking and as the sack she wascarrying felt heavier and heavier, she began to wonder how she was going tokeep up at all. And she stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozenriver with all its waterfalls of ice and at the white masses of the tree-tops and thegreat glaring moon and the countless stars and could only watch the little shortlegs of Mr Beaver going pad-pad-pad-pad through the snow in front of her as ifthey were never going to stop. Then the moon disappeared and the snow beganto fall once more. And at last Lucy was so tired that she was almost asleep andwalking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr Beaver had turnedaway from the river-bank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill intothe very thickest bushes. And then as she came fully awake she found that MrBeaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almosthidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it. In fact, by the time sherealized what was happening, only his short flat tail was showing.Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him. Then she heardnoises of scrambling and puffing and panting behind her and in a moment allfive of them were inside.“Wherever is this?” said Peter’s voice, sounding tired and pale in thedarkness. (I hope you know what I mean by a voice sounding pale.)“It’s an old hiding-place for beavers in bad times,” said Mr Beaver, “and agreat secret. It’s not much of a place but we must get a few hours’ sleep.”“If you hadn’t all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting, I’dhave brought some pillows,” said Mrs Beaver.It wasn’t nearly such a nice cave as Mr Tumnus’s, Lucy thought - just a holein the ground but dry and earthy. It was very small so that when they all laydown they were all a bundle of clothes together, and what with that and beingwarmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug. If only the floor ofthe cave had been a little smoother! Then Mrs Beaver handed round in the dark alittle flask out of which everyone drank something - it made one cough andsplutter a little and stung the throat, but it also made you feel deliciously warmafter you’d swallowed it and everyone went straight to sleep.It seemed to Lucy only the next minute (though really it was hours and hourslater) when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinkinghow she would like a hot bath. Then she felt a set of long whiskers tickling hercheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth of the cave. Butimmediately after that she was very wide awake indeed, and so was everyoneelse. In fact they were all sitting up with their mouths and eyes wide openlistening to a sound which was the very sound they’d all been thinking of (andsometimes imagining they heard) during their walk last night. It was a sound ofjingling bells.Mr Beaver was out of the cave like a flash the moment he heard it. Perhapsyou think, as Lucy thought for a moment, that this was a very silly thing to do?But it was really a very sensible one. He knew he could scramble to the top ofthe bank among bushes and brambles without being seen; and he wanted aboveall things to see which way the Witch’s sledge went. The others all sat in thecave waiting and wondering. They waited nearly five minutes. Then they heardsomething that frightened them very much. They heard voices. “Oh,” thoughtLucy, “he’s been seen. She’s caught him!”Great was their surprise when a little later, they heard Mr Beaver’s voicecalling to them from just outside the cave.“It’s all right,” he was shouting. “Come out, Mrs Beaver. Come out, Sonsand Daughters of Adam. It’s all right! It isn’t Her!” This was bad grammar ofcourse, but that is how beavers talk when they are excited; I mean, in Narnia - inour world they usually don’t talk at all.So Mrs Beaver and the children came bundling out of the cave, all blinkingin the daylight, and with earth all over them, and looking very frowsty andunbrushed and uncombed and with the sleep in their eyes.“Come on!” cried Mr Beaver, who was almost dancing with delight. “Comeand see! This is a nasty knock for the Witch! It looks as if her power is alreadycrumbling.”“What do you mean, Mr Beaver?” panted Peter as they all scrambled up thesteep bank of the valley together.“Didn’t I tell you,” answered Mr Beaver, “that she’d made it always winterand never Christmas? Didn’t I tell you? Well, just come and see!”And then they were all at the top and did see.It was a sledge, and it was reindeer with bells on their harness. But they werefar bigger than the Witch’s reindeer, and they were not white but brown. And onthe sledge sat a person whom everyone knew the moment they set eyes on him.He was a huge man. in a bright red robe (bright as hollyberries) with a hood thathad fur inside it and a great white beard, that fell like a foamy waterfall over hischest.Everyone knew him because, though you see people of his sort only inNarnia, you see pictures of them and hear them talked about even in our world the world on this side of the wardrobe door. But when you really see them inNarnia it is rather different. Some of the pictures of Father Christmas in ourworld make him look only funny and jolly. But now that the children actuallystood looking at him they didn’t find it quite like that. He was so big, and soglad, and so real, that they all became quite still. They felt very glad, but alsosolemn.“I’ve come at last,” said he. “She has kept me out for a long time, but I havegot in at last. Aslan is on the move. The Witch’s magic is weakening.”And Lucy felt running through her that deep shiver of gladness which youonly get if you are being solemn and still.“And now,” said Father Christmas, “for your presents. There is a new andbetter sewing machine for you, Mrs Beaver. I will drop it in your house as, Ipass.”“If you please, sir,” said Mrs Beaver, making a curtsey. “It’s locked up.”“Locks and bolts make no difference to me,” said Father Christmas. “And asfor you, Mr Beaver, when you get home you will find your dam finished andmended and all the leaks stopped and a new sluicegate fitted.”Mr Beaver was so pleased that he opened his mouth very wide and thenfound he couldn’t say anything at all.“Peter, Adam’s Son,” said Father Christmas.“Here, sir,” said Peter.“These are your presents,” was the answer, “and they are tools not toys. Thetime to use them is perhaps near at hand. Bear them well.” With these words hehanded to Peter a shield and a sword. The shield was the colour of silver andacross it there ramped a red lion, as bright as a ripe strawberry at the momentwhen you pick it. The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a sheath and asword belt and everything it needed, and it was just the right size and weight forPeter to use. Peter was silent and solemn as he received these gifts, for he feltthey were a very serious kind of present.“Susan, Eve’s Daughter,” said Father Christmas. “These are for you,” and hehanded her a bow and a quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn. “You mustuse the bow only in great need,” he said, “for I do not mean you to fight in thebattle. It does not easily miss. And when you put this horn to your lips; and blowit, then, wherever you are, I think help of some kind will come to you.”Last of all he said, “Lucy, Eve’s Daughter,” and Lucy came forward. He gaveher a little bottle of what looked like glass (but people said afterwards that it wasmade of diamond) and a small dagger. “In this bottle,” he said, “there is cordialmade of the juice of one of the fireflowers that grow in the mountains of the sun.If you or any of your friends is hurt, a few drops of this restore them. And thedagger is to defend yourse at great need. For you also are not to be in battle.”“Why, sir?” said Lucy. “I think - I don’t know but I think I could be braveenough.”“That is not the point,” he said. “But battles are ugly when women fight. Andnow” - here he suddenly looked less grave - “here is something for the momentfor you all!” and he brought out (I suppose from the big bag at his back, butnobody quite saw him do it) a large tray containing five cups and saucers, a bowlof lump sugar, a jug of cream, and a great big teapot all sizzling and piping hot.Then he cried out “Merry Christmas! Long live the true King!” and cracked hiswhip, and he and the reindeer and the sledge and all were out of sight beforeanyone realized that they had started.Peter had just drawn his sword out of its sheath and was showing it to MrBeaver, when Mrs Beaver said:“Now then, now then! Don’t stand talking there till the tea’s got cold. Justlike men. Come and help to carry the tray down and we’ll have breakfast. Whata mercy I thought of bringing the bread-knife.”So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave, and Mr Beaver cutsome of the bread and ham into sandwiches and Mrs Beaver poured out the teaand everyone enjoyed themselves. But long before they had finished enjoyingthemselves Mr Beaver said, “Time to be moving on now.”Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER ELEVENASLAN IS NEAREREDMUND meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time. When thedwarf had gone to get the sledge ready he expected that the Witch would startbeing nice to him, as she had been at their last meeting. But she said nothing atall. And when at last Edmund plucked up his courage to say, “Please, yourMajesty, could I have some Turkish Delight? You - you - said -” she answered,“Silence, fool!” Then she appeared to change her mind and said, as if to herself,a “And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way,” and once moreclapped her hands. Another, dwarf appeared.“Bring the human creature food and drink,” she said.The dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl withsome water in it and an iron plate with a hunk of dry bread on it. He grinned in arepulsive manner as he set them down on the floor beside Edmund and said:“Turkish Delight for the little Prince. Ha! Ha! Ha!”“Take it away,” said Edmund sulkily. “I don’t want dry bread.” But the Witchsuddenly turned on him with such a terrible expression on her face that he,apologized and began to nibble at the bread, though, it was so stale he couldhardly get it down.“You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again,” said the Witch.While he was still chewing away the first dwarf came back and announcedthat the sledge was ready. The White Witch rose and went out, ordering Edmundto go with her. The snow was again falling as they came into the courtyard, butshe took no notice of that and made Edmund sit beside her on the sledge. Butbefore they drove off she called Maugrim and he came bounding like anenormous dog to the side of the sledge.“Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of theBeavers,” said the Witch, “and kill whatever you find there. If they are alreadygone, then make all speed to the Stone Table, but do not be seen. Wait for methere in hiding. I meanwhile must go many miles to the West before I find aplace where I can drive across the river. You may overtake these humans beforethey reach the Stone Table. You will know what to do if you find them!”“I hear and obey, O Queen,” growled the Wolf, and immediately he shotaway into the snow and darkness, as quickly as a horse can gallop. In a fewminutes he had called another wolf and was with him down on the dam sniffingat the Beavers’ house. But of course they found it empty. It would have been adreadful thing for the Beavers and the children if the night had remained fine, forthe wolves would then have been able to follow their trail - and ten to one wouldhave overtaken them before they had got to the cave. But now that the snow hadbegun again the scent was cold and even the footprints were covered up.Meanwhile the dwarf whipped up the reindeer, and the Witch and Edmunddrove out under the archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold.This was a terrible journey for Edmund, who had no coat. Before they had beengoing quarter of an hour all the front of him was covered with snow - he soonstopped trying to shake it off because, as quickly as he did that, a new lotgathered, and he was so tired. Soon he was wet to the skin. And oh, howmiserable he was! It didn’t look now as if the Witch intended to make him aKing. All the things he had said to make himself believe that she was good andkind and that her side was really the right side sounded to him silly now. Hewould have given anything to meet the others at this moment - even Peter! Theonly way to comfort himself now was to try to believe that the whole thing was adream and that he might wake up at any moment. And as they went on, hourafter hour, it did come to seem like a dream.This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote pages and pagesabout it. But I will skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and themorning had come and they were racing along in the daylight. And still theywent on and on, with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow and thecreaking of the reindeer’s harness. And then at last the Witch said, “What havewe here? Stop!” and they did.How Edmund hoped she was going to say something about breakfast! Butshe had stopped for quite a different reason. A little way off at the foot of a treesat a merry party, a squirrel and his wife with their children and two satyrs and adwarf and an old dogfox, all on stools round a table. Edmund couldn’t quite seewhat they were eating, but it smelled lovely and there seemed to be decorationsof holly and he wasn’t at all sure that he didn’t see something like a plumpudding. At the moment when the sledge stopped, the Fox, who was obviouslythe oldest person present, had just risen to its feet, holding a glass in its right pawas if it was going to say something. But when the whole party saw the sledgestopping and who was in it, all the gaiety went out of their faces. The fathersquirrel stopped eating with his fork half-way to his mouth and one of the satyrsstopped with its fork actually in its mouth, and the baby squirrels squeaked withterror.“What is the meaning of this?” asked the Witch Queen. Nobody answered.“Speak, vermin!” she said again. “Or do you want my dwarf to find you atongue with his whip? What is the meaning of all this gluttony, this waste, thisselfindulgence? Where did you get all these things?”“Please, your Majesty,” said the Fox, “we were given them. And if I mightmake so bold as to drink your Majesty’s very good health - ““Who gave them to you?” said the Witch.“F-F-F-Father Christmas,” stammered the Fox.“What?” roared the Witch, springing from the sledge and taking a few stridesnearer to the terrified animals. “He has not been here! He cannot have been here!How dare you - but no. Say you have been lying and you shall even now beforgiven.”At that moment one of the young squirrels lost its head completely.“He has - he has - he has!” it squeaked, beating its little spoon on the table.Edmund saw the Witch bite her lips so that a drop of blood appeared on herwhite cheek. Then she raised her wand. “Oh, don’t, don’t, please don’t,” shoutedEdmund, but even while he was shouting she had waved her wand and instantlywhere the merry party had been there were only statues of creatures (one with itsstone fork fixed forever half-way to its stone mouth) seated round a stone tableon which there were stone plates and a stone plum pudding.“As for you,” said the Witch, giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face asshe re-mounted the sledge, “let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors.Drive on!” And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someonebesides himself. It seemed so pitiful to think of those little stone figures sittingthere all the silent days and all the dark nights, year after year, till the moss grewon them and at last even their faces crumbled away.Now they were steadily racing on again. And soon Edmund noticed that thesnow which splashed against them as they rushed through it was much wetterthan it had been all last night. At the same time he noticed that he was feelingmuch less cold. It was also becoming foggy. In fact every minute it grew foggierand warmer. And the sledge was not running nearly as well as it had beenrunning up till now. At first he thought this was because the reindeer were tired,but soon he saw that that couldn’t be the real reason. The sledge jerked, andskidded and kept on jolting as if it had struck against stones. And however thedwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower. There alsoseemed to be a curious noise all round them, but the noise of their driving andjolting and the dwarf’s shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearingwhat it was, until suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn’t go on at all.When that happened there was a moment’s silence. And in that silence Edmundcould at last listen to the other noise properly. A strange, sweet, rustling,chattering noise - and yet not so strange, for he’d heard it before - if only hecould remember where! Then all at once he did remember. It was the noise ofrunning water. All round them though out of sight, there were streams,chattering, murmuring, bubbling, splashing and even (in the distance) roaring.And his heart gave a great leap (though he hardly knew why) when he realizedthat the frost was over. And much nearer there was a drip-drip-drip from thebranches of all the trees. And then, as he looked at one tree he saw a great loadof snow slide off it and for the first time since he had entered Narnia he saw thedark green of a fir tree. But he hadn’t time to listen or watch any longer, for theWitch said:“Don’t sit staring, fool! Get out and help.”And of course Edmund had to obey. He stepped out into the snow - but itwas really only slush by now - and began helping the dwarf to get the sledge outof the muddy hole it had got into. They got it out in the end, and by being verycruel to the reindeer the dwarf managed to get it on the move again, and theydrove a little further. And now the snow was really melting in earnest andpatches of green grass were beginning to appear in every direction. Unless youhave looked at a world of snow as long as Edmund had been looking at it, youwill hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patches were after theendless white. Then the sledge stopped again.“It’s no good, your Majesty,” said the dwarf. “We can’t sledge in this thaw.”“Then we must walk,” said the Witch.“We shall never overtake them walking,” growled the dwarf. “Not with thestart they’ve got.”“Are you my councillor or my slave?” said the Witch. “Do as you’re told.Tie the hands of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of therope. And take your whip. And cut the harness of the reindeer; they’ll find theirown way home.”The dwarf obeyed, and in a few minutes Edmund found himself being forcedto walk as fast as he could with his hands tied behind him. He kept on slipping inthe slush and mud and wet grass, and every time he slipped the dwarf gave him acurse and sometimes a flick with the whip. The Witch walked behind the dwarfand kept on saying, “Faster! Faster!”Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of spowgrew smaller. Every moment more and more of the trees shook off their robes ofsnow. Soon, wherever you looked, instead of white shapes you saw the darkgreen of firs or the black prickly branches of bare oaks and beeches and elms.Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared away altogether.Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down on to the forest floor and overhead youcould see a blue sky between the tree tops.Soon there were more wonderful things happening. Coming suddenly rounda corner into a glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in alldirections with little yellow flowers - celandines. The noise of water grewlouder. Presently they actually crossed a stream. Beyond it they foundsnowdrops growing.“Mind your own business!” said the dwarf when he saw that Edmund hadturned his head to look at them; and he gave the rope a vicious jerk.But of course this didn’t prevent Edmund from seeing. Only five minuteslater he noticed a dozen crocuses growing round the foot of an old tree - goldand purple and white. Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound ofthe water. Close beside the path they were following a bird suddenly chirpedfrom the branch of a tree. It was answered by the chuckle of another bird a littlefurther off. And then, as if that had been a signal, there was chattering andchirruping in every direction, and then a moment of full song, and within fiveminutes the whole wood was ringing with birds’ music, and wherever Edmund’seyes turned he saw birds alighting on branches, or sailing overhead or chasingone another or having their little quarrels or tidying up their feathers with theirbeaks.“Faster! Faster!” said the Witch.There was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer, and nowthere were white clouds hurrying across it from time to time. In the wide gladesthere were primroses. A light breeze sprang up which scattered drops of moisturefrom the swaying branches and carried cool, delicious scents against the faces ofthe travellers. The trees began to come fully alive. The larches and birches werecovered with green, the laburnums with gold. Soon the beech trees had put forththeir delicate, transparent leaves. As the travellers walked under them the lightalso became green. A bee buzzed across their path.“This is no thaw,” said the dwarf, suddenly stopping. “This is Spring. Whatare we to do? Your winter has been destroyed, I tell you! This is Aslan’s doing.”“If either of you mention that name again,” said the Witch, “he shall instantlybe killed.”Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER TWELVEPETER’S FIRST BATTLEWHILE the dwarf and the White Witch were saying this, miles away theBeavers and the children were walking on hour after hour into what seemed adelicious dream. Long ago they had left the coats behind them. And by now theyhad even stopped saying to one another, “Look! there’s a kingfisher,” or “I say,bluebells!” or “What was that lovely smell?” or “Just listen to that thrush!” Theywalked on in silence drinking it all in, passing through patches of warm sunlightinto cool, green thickets and out again into wide mossy glades where tall elmsraised the leafy roof far overhead, and then into dense masses of floweringcurrant and among hawthorn bushes where the sweet smell was almostoverpowering.They had been just as surprised as Edmund when they saw the wintervanishing and the whole wood passing in a few hours or so from January to May.They hadn’t even known for certain (as the Witch did) that this was what wouldhappen when Aslan came to Narnia. But they all knew that it was her spellswhich had produced the endless winter; and therefore they all knew when thismagic spring began that something had gone wrong, and badly wrong, with theWitch’s schemes. And after the thaw had been going on for some time they allrealized that the Witch would no longer be able to use her sledge. After that theydidn’t hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rests and longer ones.They were pretty tired by now of course; but not what I’d call bitterly tired only slow and feeling very dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one iscoming to the end of a long day in the open. Susan had a slight blister on oneheel.They had left the course of the big river some time ago; for one had to turn alittle to the right (that meant a little to the south) to reach the place of the StoneTable. Even if this had not been their way they couldn’t have kept to the rivervalley once the thaw began, for with all that melting snow the river was soon inflood - a wonderful, roaring, thundering yellow flood - and their path wouldhave been under water.And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadows got longerand the flowers began to think about closing.“Not long now,” said Mr Beaver, and began leading them uphill across somevery deep, springy moss (it felt nice under their tired feet) in a place where onlytall trees grew, very wide apart. The climb, coming at the end of the long day,made them all pant and blow. And just as Lucy was wondering whether shecould really get to the top without another long rest, suddenly they were at thetop. And this is what they saw.They were on a green open space from which you could look down on theforest spreading as far as one could see in every direction - except right ahead.There, far to the East, was something twinkling and moving. “By gum!”whispered Peter to Susan, “the sea!” In the very middle of this open hill-top wasthe Stone Table. It was a great grim slab of grey stone supported on four uprightstones. It looked very old; and it was cut all over with strange lines and figuresthat might be the letters of an unknown language. They gave you a curiousfeeling when you looked at them. The next thing they saw was a pavilion pitchedon one side of the open place. A wonderful pavilion it was - and especially nowwhen the light of the setting sun fell upon it - with sides of what looked likeyellow silk and cords of crimson and tent-pegs of ivory; and high above it on apole a banner which bore a red rampant lion fluttering in the breeze which wasblowing in their faces from the far-off sea. While they were looking at this theyheard a sound of music on their right; and turning in that direction they saw whatthey had come to see.Aslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creatures who had groupedthemselves round him in the shape of a half-moon. There were Tree-Womenthere and Well-Women (Dryads and Naiads as they used to be called in ourworld) who had stringed instruments; it was they who had made the music.There were four great centaurs. The horse part of them was like huge Englishfarm horses, and the man part was like stern but beautiful giants. There was alsoa unicorn, and a bull with the head of a man, and a pelican, and an eagle, and agreat Dog. And next to Aslan stood two leopards of whom one carried his crownand the other his standard.But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn’t know what todo or say when they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia sometimesthink that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time. If the childrenhad ever thought so, they were cured of it now. For when they tried to look atAslan’s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal,solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn’t look at him andwent all trembly.“Go on,” whispered Mr Beaver.“No,” whispered Peter, “you first.”“No, Sons of Adam before animals,” whispered Mr Beaver back again.“Susan,” whispered Peter, “What about you? Ladies first.”“No, you’re the eldest,” whispered Susan. And of course the longer theywent on doing this the more awkward they felt. Then at last Peter realized that itwas up to him. He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and hastily saying tothe others “Come on. Pull yourselves together,” he advanced to the Lion andsaid:“We have come - Aslan.”“Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam,” said Aslan. “Welcome, Susan and Lucy,Daughters of Eve. Welcome He-Beaver and She-Beaver.”His voice was deep and rich and somehow took the fidgets out of them. Theynow felt glad and quiet and it didn’t seem awkward to them to stand and saynothing.“But where is the fourth?” asked Aslan.“He has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch, O Aslan,” said MrBeaver. And then something made Peter say,“That was partly my fault, Aslan. I was angry with him and I think thathelped him to go wrong.”And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but merelystood looking at him with his great unchanging eyes. And it seemed to all ofthem that there was nothing to be said.“Please - Aslan,” said Lucy, “can anything be done to save Edmund?”“All shall be done,” said Aslan. “But it may be harder than you think.” Andthen he was silent again for some time. Up to that moment Lucy had beenthinking how royal and strong and peaceful his face looked; now it suddenlycame into her head that he looked sad as well. But next minute that expressionwas quite gone. The Lion shook his mane and clapped his paws together(”Terrible paws,” thought Lucy, “if he didn’t know how to velvet them!”) andsaid,“Meanwhile, let the feast be prepared. Ladies, take these Daughters of Eve tothe pavilion and minister to them.”When the girls had gone Aslan laid his paw - and though it was velveted itwas very heavy - on Peter’s shoulder and said, “Come, Son of Adam, and I willshow you a far-off sight of the castle where you are to be King.”And Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to theeastern edge of the hilltop. There a beautiful sight met their eyes. The sun wassetting behind their backs. That meant that the whole country below them lay inthe evening light - forest and hills and valleys and, winding away like a silversnake, the lower part of the great river. And beyond all this, miles away, was thesea, and beyond the sea the sky, full of clouds which were just turning rosecolour with the reflection of the sunset. But just where the land of Narnia met thesea - in fact, at the mouth of the great river - there was something on a little hill,shining. It was shining because it was a castle and of course the sunlight wasreflected from all the windows which looked towards Peter and the sunset; but toPeter it looked like a great star resting on the seashore.“That, O Man,” said Aslan, “is Cair Paravel of the four thrones, in one ofwhich you must sit as King. I show it to you because you are the first-born andyou will be High King over all the rest.”And once more Peter said nothing, for at that moment a strange noise wokethe silence suddenly. It was like a bugle, but richer.“It is your sister’s horn,” said Aslan to Peter in a low voice; so low as to bealmost a purr, if it is not disrespectful to think of a Lion purring.For a moment Peter did not understand. Then, when he saw all the othercreatures start forward and heard Aslan say with a wave of his paw, “Back! Letthe Prince win his spurs,” he did understand, and set off running as hard as hecould to the pavilion. And there he saw a dreadful sight.The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction. Lucy was runningtowards him as fast as her short legs would carry her and her face was as whiteas paper. Then he saw Susan make a dash for a tree, and swing herself up,followed by a huge grey beast. At first Peter thought it was a bear. Then he sawthat it looked like an Alsatian, though it was far too big to be a dog. Then herealized that it was a wolf - a wolf standing on its hind legs, with its front pawsagainst the tree-trunk, snapping and snarling. All the hair on its back stood up onend. Susan had not been able to get higher than the second big branch. One ofher legs hung down so that her foot was only an inch or two above the snappingteeth. Peter wondered why she did not get higher or at least take a better grip;then he realized that she was just going to faint and that if she fainted she wouldfall off.Peter did not feel very brave; indeed, he felt he was going to be sick. But thatmade no difference to what he had to do. He rushed straight up to the monsterand aimed a slash of his sword at its side. That stroke never reached the Wolf.Quick as lightning it turned round, its eyes flaming, and its mouth wide open in ahowl of anger. If it had not been so angry that it simply had to howl it wouldhave got him by the throat at once. As it was - though all this happened tooquickly for Peter to think at all - he had just time to duck down and plunge hissword, as hard as he could, between the brute’s forelegs into its heart. Then camea horrible, confused moment like something in a nightmare. He was tugging andpulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead, and its bared teeth knockedagainst his forehead, and everything was blood and heat and hair. A momentlater he found that the monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it andwas straightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his eyes.He felt tired all over.Then, after a bit, Susan came down the tree. She and Peter felt pretty shakywhen they met and I won’t say there wasn’t kissing and crying on both sides.But in Narnia no one thinks any the worse of you for that.“Quick! Quick!” shouted the voice of Aslan. “Centaurs! Eagles! I seeanother wolf in the thickets. There - behind you. He has just darted away. Afterhim, all of you. He will be going to his mistress. Now is your chance to find theWitch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam.” And instantly with a thunder ofhoofs and beating of wings a dozen or so of the swiftest creatures disappearedinto the gathering darkness.Peter, still out of breath, turned and saw Aslan close at hand.“You have forgotten to clean your sword,” said Aslan.It was true. Peter blushed when he looked at the bright blade and saw it allsmeared with the Wolf’s hair and blood. He stooped down and wiped it quiteclean on the grass, and then wiped it quite dry on his coat.“Hand it to me and kneel, Son of Adam,” said Aslan. And when Peter haddone so he struck him with the flat of the blade and said, “Rise up, Sir PeterWolf’s-Bane. And, whatever happens, never forget to wipe your sword.”Now we must get back to Edmund. When he had been made to walk farfurther than he had ever known that anybody could walk, the Witch at last haltedin a dark valley all overshadowed with fir trees and yew trees. Edmund simplysank down and lay on his face doing nothing at all and not even caring what wasgoing to happen next provided they would let him lie still. He was too tired evento notice how hungry and thirsty he was. The Witch and the dwarf were talkingclose beside him in low tones.“No,” said the dwarf, “it is no use now, O Queen. They must have reachedthe Stone Table by now.”“Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news,” said the Witch.“It cannot be good news if he does,” said the dwarf.“Four thrones in Cair Paravel,” said the Witch. “How if only three werefilled? That would not fulfil the prophecy.”“What difference would that make now that He is here?” said the dwarf. Hedid not dare, even now, to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress.“He may not stay long. And then - we would fall upon the three at Cair.”“Yet it might be better,” said the dwarf, “to keep this one” (here he kickedEdmund) “for bargaining with.”Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER THIRTEENDEEP MAGIC FROM THE DAWN OF TIME“Yes! and have him rescued,” said the Witch scornfully.“Then,” said the dwarf, “we had better do what we have to do at once.”“I would like to have it done on the Stone Table itself,” said the Witch. “Thatis the proper place. That is where it has always been done before.”“It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to itsproper use,” said the dwarf.“True,” said the Witch; and then, “Well, I will begin.”At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them.“I have seen them. They are all at the Stone Table, with Him. They havekilled my captain, Maugrim. I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all. One ofthe Sons of Adam killed him. Fly! Fly!”“No,” said the Witch. “There need be no flying. Go quickly. Summon all ourpeople to meet me here as speedily as they can. Call out the giants and thewerewolves and the spirits of those trees who are on our side. Call the Ghouls,and the Boggles, the Ogres and the Minotaurs. Call the Cruels, the Hags, theSpectres, and the people of the Toadstools. We will fight. What? Have I not stillmy wand? Will not their ranks turn into stone even as they come on? Be offquickly, I have a little thing to finish here while you are away.”The great brute bowed its head, turned, and galloped away.“Now!” she said, “we have no table - let me see. We had better put it againstthe trunk of a tree.”Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his feet. Then the dwarf sethim with his back against a tree and bound him fast. He saw the Witch take offher outer mantle. Her arms were bare underneath it and terribly white. Becausethey were so very white he could see them, but he could not see much else, itwas so dark in this valley under the dark trees.“Prepare the victim,”, said the Witch. And the dwarf undid Edmund’s collarand folded back his shirt at the neck. Then he took Edmund’s hair and pulled hishead back so that he had to raise his chin. After that Edmund heard a strangenoise - whizz whizz - whizz. For a moment he couldn’t think what it was. Thenhe realized. It was the sound of a knife being sharpened.At that very moment he heard loud shouts from every direction - a drummingof hoofs and a beating of wings - a scream from the Witch - confusion all roundhim. And then he found he was being untied. Strong arms were round him andhe heard big, kind voices saying things like “Let him lie down - give him some wine - drink this - steady now - you’ll beall right in a minute.”Then he heard the voices of people who were not talking to him but to oneanother. And they were saying things like “Who’s got the Witch?” “I thoughtyou had her.” “I didn’t see her after I knocked the knife out of her hand - I wasafter the dwarf - do you mean to say she’s escaped?” “- A chap can’t mindeverything at once - what’s that? Oh, sorry, it’s only an old stump!” But just atthis point Edmund went off in a dead faint.Presently the centaurs and unicorns and deer and birds (they were of coursethe rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter) all set off to go back tothe Stone Table, carrying Edmund with them. But if they could have seen whathappened in that valley after they had gone, I think they might have beensurprised.It was perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright; if you had beenthere you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree-stump and on afairsized boulder. But if you had gone on looking you would gradually havebegun to think there was something odd about both the stump and the boulder.And next you would have thought that the stump did look really remarkably likea little fat man crouching on the ground. And if you had watched long enoughyou would have seen the stump walk across to the boulder and the boulder sit upand begin talking to the stump; for in reality the stump and the boulder weresimply the Witch and the dwarf. For it was part of her magic that she could makethings look like what they aren’t, and she had the presence of mind to do so atthe very moment when the knife was knocked out of her hand. She had kept holdof her wand, so it had been kept safe, too.When the other children woke up next morning (they had been sleeping onpiles of cushions in the pavilion) the first thing they heard -from Mrs Beaver was that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late last night;and was at that moment with Aslan. As soon as they had breakfasted4 they allwent out, and there they saw Aslan and Edmund walking together in the dewygrass, apart from the rest of the court. There is no need to tell you (and no oneever heard) what Aslan was saying, but it was a conversation which Edmundnever forgot. As the others drew nearer Aslan turned to meet them, bringingEdmund with him.“Here is your brother,” he said, “and - there is no need to talk to him aboutwhat is past.”Edmund shook hands with each of the others and said to each of them inturn, “I’m sorry,” and everyone said, “That’s all right.” And then everyonewanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that theywere all friends with him again -something ordinary and natural -and of courseno one could think of anything in the world to say. But before they had time tofeel really awkward one of the leopards approached Aslan and said,“Sire, there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience.”“Let him approach,” said Aslan.The leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch’s dwarf.“What is your message, Son of Earth?” asked Aslan.“The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safeconduct to come and speak with you,” said the dwarf, “on a matter which is asmuch to your advantage as to hers.”“Queen of Narnia, indeed!” said Mr Beaver. “Of all the cheek -““Peace, Beaver,” said Aslan. “All names will soon be restored to their properowners. In the meantime we will not dispute about them. Tell your mistress, Sonof Earth, that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she leaves her wandbehind her at that great oak.”This was agreed to and two leopards went back with the dwarf to see that theconditions were properly carried out. “But supposing she turns the two leopardsinto stone?” whispered Lucy to Peter. I think the same idea had occurred to theleopards themselves; at any rate, as they walked off their fur was all standing upon their backs and their tails were bristling - like a cat’s when it sees a strangedog.“It’ll be all right,” whispered Peter in reply. “He wouldn’t send them if itweren’t.”A few minutes later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the hill andcame straight across and stood before Aslan. The three children who had notseen her before felt shudders running down their backs at the sight of her face;and there were low growls among all the animals present. Though it was brightsunshine everyone felt suddenly cold. The only two people present who seemedto be quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself. It was the oddest thingto see those two faces - the golden face and the dead-white face so closetogether. Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in his eyes; Mrs Beaverparticularly noticed this.“You have a traitor there, Aslan,” said the Witch. Of course everyone presentknew that she meant Edmund. But Edmund had got past thinking about himselfafter all he’d been through and after the talk he’d had that morning. He just wenton looking at Aslan. It didn’t seem to matter what the Witch said.“Well,” said Aslan. “His offence was not against you.”“Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?” asked the Witch.“Let us say I have forgotten it,” answered Aslan gravely. “Tell us of thisDeep Magic.”“Tell you?” said the Witch, her voice growing suddenly shriller. “Tell youwhat is written on that very Table of Stone which stands beside us? Tell youwhat is written in letters deep as a spear is long on the firestones on the SecretHill? Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor-beyond-the-Sea?You at least know the Magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the verybeginning. You know that every traitor belongs to me as my lawful prey and thatfor every treachery I have a right to a kill.”“Oh,” said Mr Beaver. “So that’s how you came to imagine yourself a queen- because you were the Emperor’s hangman. I see.”“Peace, Beaver,” said Aslan, with a very low growl. “And so,” continued theWitch, “that human creature is mine. His life is forfeit to me. His blood is myproperty.”“Come and take it then,” said the Bull with the man’s head in a greatbellowing voice.“Fool,” said the Witch with a savage smile that was almost a snarl, “do youreally think your master can rob me of my rights by mere force? He knows theDeep Magic better than that. He knows that unless I have blood as the Law saysall Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water.”“It is very true,” said Aslan, “I do not deny it.”“Oh, Aslan!” whispered Susan in the Lion’s ear, “can’t we - I mean, youwon’t, will you? Can’t we do something about the Deep Magic? Isn’t theresomething you can work against it?”“Work against the Emperor’s Magic?” said Aslan, turning to her withsomething like a frown on his face. And nobody ever made that suggestion tohim again.Edmund was on the other side of Aslan, looking all the time at Aslan’s face.He felt a choking feeling and wondered if he ought to say something; but amoment later he felt that he was not expected to do anything except to wait, anddo what he was told.“Fall back, all of you,” said Aslan, “and I will talk to the Witch alone.”They all obeyed. It was a terrible time this - waiting and wondering while theLion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voices. Lucy said, “Oh,Edmund!” and began to cry. Peter stood with his back to the others looking outat the distant sea. The Beavers stood holding each other’s paws with their headsbowed. The centaurs stamped uneasily with their hoofs. But everyone becameperfectly still in the end, so that you noticed even small sounds like a bumblebee flying past, or the birds in the forest down below them, or the wind rustlingthe leaves. And still the talk between Aslan and the White Witch went on.At last they heard Aslan’s voice, “You can all come back,” he said. “I havesettled the matter. She has renounced the claim on your brother’s blood.” And allover the hill there was a noise as if everyone had been holding their breath andhad now begun breathing again, and then a murmur of talk.The Witch was just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her face whenshe stopped and said,“But how do I know this promise will be kept?”“Haa-a-arrh!” roared Aslan, half rising from his throne; and his great mouthopened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder, and the Witch,after staring for a moment with her lips wide apart, picked up her skirts andfairly ran for her life.Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER FOURTEENTHE TRIUMPH OF THE WITCHAs soon as the Witch had gone Aslan said, “We must move from this place atonce, it will be wanted for other purposes. We shall encamp tonight at the Fordsof Beruna.Of course everyone was dying to ask him how he had arranged matters withthe witch; but his face was stern and everyone’s ears were still ringing with thesound of his roar and so nobody dared.After a meal, which was taken in the open air on the hill-top (for the sun hadgot strong by now and dried the grass), they were busy for a while taking thepavilion down and packing things up. Before two o’clock they were on themarch and set off in a northeasterly direction, walking at an easy pace for theyhad not far to go.During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan ofcampaign. “As soon as she has finished her business in these parts,” he said, “theWitch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her House and prepare for asiege. You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reachingit.” He then went on to outline two plans of battle - one for fighting the Witchand her people in the wood and another for assaulting her castle. And all the timehe was advising Peter how to conduct the operations, saying things like, “Youmust put your Centaurs in such and such a place” or “You must post scouts tosee that she doesn’t do so-and-so,” till at last Peter said,“But you will be there yourself, Aslan.”“I can give you no promise of that,” answered the Lion. And he continuedgiving Peter his instructions.For the last part of the journey it was Susan and Lucy who saw most of him.He did not talk very much and seemed to them to be sad.It was still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river valleyhad widened out and the river was broad and shallow. This was the Fords ofBeruna and Aslan gave orders to halt on this side of the water. But Peter said,“Wouldn’t it be better to camp on the far side - for fear she should try a nightattack or anything?”Aslan, who seemed to have been thinking about something else, rousedhimself with a shake of his magnificent mane and said, “Eh? What’s that?” Petersaid it all over again.“No,” said Aslan in a dull voice, as if it didn’t matter. “No. She will notmake an attack to-night.” And then he sighed deeply. But presently he added,“All the same it was well thought of. That is how a soldier ought to think. But itdoesn’t really matter.” So they proceeded to pitch their camp.Aslan’s mood affected everyone that evening. Peter was feelinguncomfortable too at the idea of fighting the battle on his own; the news thatAslan might not be there had come as a great shock to him. Supper that eveningwas a quiet meal. Everyone felt how different it had been last night or even thatmorning. It was as if the good times, having just begun, were already drawing totheir end.This feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn’t get to sleep when shewent to bed. And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and over sheheard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over just beside her in the darkness.“Can’t you get to sleep either?” said Susan.“No,” said Lucy. “I thought you were asleep. I say, Susan!”“What?”“I’ve a most Horrible feeling - as if something were hanging over us.”“Have you? Because, as a matter of fact, so have I.”“Something about Aslan,” said Lucy. “Either some dreadful thing is going tohappen to him, or something dreadful that he’s going to do.”“There’s been something wrong with him all afternoon,” said Susan. “Lucy!What was that he said about not being with us at the battle? You don’t think hecould be stealing away and leaving us tonight, do you?”“Where is he now?” said Lucy. “Is he here in the pavilion?”“I don’t think so.”“Susan! let’s go outside and have a look round. We might see him.”“All right. Let’s,” said Susan; “we might just as well be doing that as lyingawake here.”Very quietly the two girls groped their way among the other sleepers andcrept out of the tent. The moonlight was bright and everything was quite stillexcept for the noise of the river chattering over the stones. Then Susan suddenlycaught Lucy’s arm and said, “Look!” On the far side of the camping ground, justwhere the trees began, they saw the Lion slowly walking away from them intothe wood. Without a word they both followed him.He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to theright - apparently by the very same route which they had used that afternoon incoming from the Hill of the Stone Table. On and on he led them, into darkshadows and out into pale moonlight, getting their feet wet with the heavy dew.He looked somehow different from the Aslan they knew. His tail and his headhung low and he walked slowly as if he were very, very tired. Then, when theywere crossing a wide open place where there where no shadows for them to hidein, he stopped and looked round. It was no good trying to run away so they cametowards him. When they were closer he said,“Oh, children, children, why are you following me?”“We couldn’t sleep,” said Lucy - and then felt sure that she need say no moreand that Aslan knew all they had been thinking.“Please, may we come with you - wherever you’re going?” asked Susan.“Well -” said Aslan, and seemed to be thinking. Then he said, “I should beglad of company tonight. Yes, you may come, if you will promise to stop when Itell you, and after that leave me to go on alone.”“Oh, thank you, thank you. And we will,” said the two girls.Forward they went again and one of the girls walked on each side of theLion. But how slowly he walked! And his great, royal head drooped so that hisnose nearly touched the grass. Presently he stumbled and gave a low moan.“Aslan! Dear Aslan!” said Lucy, “what is wrong? Can’t you tell us?”“Are you ill, dear Aslan?” asked Susan.“No,” said Aslan. “I am sad and lonely. Lay your hands on my mane so that Ican feel you are there and let us walk like that.”And so the girls did what they would never have dared to do without hispermission, but what they had longed to do ever since they first saw him buriedtheir cold hands in the beautiful sea of fur and stroked it and, so doing, walkedwith him. And presently they saw that they were going with him up the slope ofthe hill on which the Stone Table stood. They went up at the side where the treescame furthest up, and when they got to the last tree (it was one that had somebushes about it) Aslan stopped and said,“Oh, children, children. Here you must stop. And whatever happens, do notlet yourselves be seen. Farewell.”And both the girls cried bitterly (though they hardly knew why) and clung tothe Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paws and his great, sad eyes.Then he turned from them and walked out on to the top of the hill. And Lucy andSusan, crouching in the bushes, looked after him, and this is what they saw.A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and thoughthe moon was shining many of them carried torches which burned with evillooking red flames and black smoke. But such people! Ogres with monstrousteeth, and wolves, and bull-headed men; spirits of evil trees and poisonousplants; and other creatures whom I won’t describe because if I did the grownupswould probably not let you read this book - Cruels and Hags and Incubuses,Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Sprites, Orknies, Wooses, and Ettins. In fact here wereall those who were on the Witch’s side and whom the Wolf had summoned at hercommand. And right in the middle, standing by the Table, was the Witch herself.A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creatures when they firstsaw the great Lion pacing towards them, and for a moment even the Witchseemed to be struck with fear. Then she recovered herself and gave a wild fiercelaugh.“The fool!” she cried. “The fool has come. Bind him fast.”Lucy and Susan held their breaths waiting for Aslan’s roar and his springupon his enemies. But it never came. Four Hags, grinning and leering, yet also(at first) hanging back and half afraid of what they had to do, had approachedhim. “Bind him, I say!” repeated the White Witch. The Hags made a dart at himand shrieked with triumph when they found that he made no resistance at all.Then others - evil dwarfs and apes - rushed in to help them, and between themthey rolled the huge Lion over on his back and tied all his four paws together,shouting and cheering as if they had done something brave, though, had the Lionchosen, one of those paws could have been the death of them all. But he made nonoise, even when the enemies, straining and tugging, pulled the cords so tightthat they cut into his flesh. Then they began to drag him towards the Stone Table.“Stop!” said the Witch. “Let him first be shaved.”Another roar of mean laughter went up from her followers as an ogre with apair of shears came forward and squatted down by Aslan’s head. Snip-snip-snipwent the shears and masses of curling gold began to fall to the ground. Then theogre stood back and the children, watching from their hiding-place, could see theface of Aslan looking all small and different without its mane. The enemies alsosaw the difference.“Why, he’s only a great cat after all!” cried one.“Is that what we were afraid of?” said another.And they surged round Aslan, jeering at him, saying things like “Puss, Puss!Poor Pussy,” and “How many mice have you caught today, Cat?” and “Wouldyou like a saucer of milk, Pussums?”“Oh, how can they?” said Lucy, tears streaming down her cheeks. “Thebrutes, the brutes!” for now that the first shock was over the shorn face of Aslanlooked to her braver, and more beautiful, and more patient than ever.“Muzzle him!” said the Witch. And even now, as they worked about his faceputting on the muzzle, one bite from his jaws would have cost two or three ofthem their hands. But he never moved. And this seemed to enrage all that rabble.Everyone was at him now. Those who had been afraid to come near him evenafter he was bound began to find their courage, and for a few minutes the twogirls could not even see him - so thickly was he surrounded by the whole crowdof creatures kicking him, hitting him, spitting on him, jeering at him.At last the rabble had had enough of this. They began to drag the bound andmuzzled Lion to the Stone Table, some pulling and some pushing. He was sohuge that even when they got him there it took all their efforts to hoist him on tothe surface of it. Then there was more tying and tightening of cords.“The cowards! The cowards!” sobbed Susan. “Are they still afraid of him,even now?”When once Aslan had been tied (and tied so that he was really a mass ofcords) on the flat stone, a hush fell on the crowd. Four Hags, holding fourtorches, stood at the corners of the Table. The Witch bared her arms as she hadbared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of Aslan. Thenshe began to whet her knife. It looked to the children, when the gleam of thetorchlight fell on it, as if the knife were made of stone, not of steel, and it was ofa strange and evil shape.As last she drew near. She stood by Aslan’s head. Her face was working andtwitching with passion, but his looked up at the sky, still quiet, neither angry norafraid, but a little sad. Then, just before she gave the blow, she stooped down andsaid in a quivering voice,“And now, who has won? Fool, did you think that by all this you would savethe human traitor? Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was and so theDeep Magic will be appeased. But when you are dead what will prevent me fromkilling him as well? And who will take him out of my hand then? Understandthat you have given me Narnia forever, you have lost your own life and you havenot saved his. In that knowledge, despair and die.”The children did not see the actual moment of the killing. They couldn’t bearto look and had covered their eyes.Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER FIFTEENDEEPER MAGIC FROM BEFORE THE DAWN OF TIMEWHILE the two girls still crouched in the bushes with their hands over theirfaces, they heard the voice of the Witch calling out,“Now! Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war! It willnot take us long to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that the greatFool, the great Cat, lies dead.”At this moment the children were for a few seconds in very great danger. Forwith wild cries and a noise of skirling pipes and shrill horns blowing, the wholeof that vile rabble came sweeping off the hill-top and down the slope right pasttheir hiding-place. They felt the Spectres go by them like a cold wind and theyfelt the ground shake beneath them under the galloping feet of the Minotaurs;and overhead there went a flurry of foul wings and a blackness of vultures andgiant bats. At any other time they would have trembled with fear; but now thesadness and shame and horror of Aslan’s death so filled their minds that theyhardly thought of it.As soon as the wood was silent again Susan and Lucy crept out onto theopen hill-top. The moon was getting low and thin clouds were passing acrossher, but still they could see the shape of the Lion lying dead in his bonds. Anddown they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his cold face and stroked hisbeautiful fur - what was left of it - and cried till they could cry no more. Andthen they looked at each other and held each other’s hands for mere lonelinessand cried again; and then again were silent. At last Lucy said,“I can’t bear to look at that horrible muzzle. I wonder could we take if off?”So they tried. And after a lot of working at it (for their fingers were cold andit was now the darkest part of the night) they succeeded. And when they saw hisface without it they burst out crying again and kissed it and fondled it and wipedaway the blood and the foam as well as they could. And it was all more lonelyand hopeless and horrid than I know how to describe.“I wonder could we untie him as well?” said Susan presently. But theenemies, out of pure spitefulness, had drawn the cords so tight that the girlscould make nothing of the knots.I hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan andLucy were that night; but if you have been - if you’ve been up all night and criedtill you have no more tears left in you - you will know that there comes in theend a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing was ever going to happen again. Atany rate that was how it felt to these two. Hours and hours seemed to go by inthis dead calm, and they hardly noticed that they were getting colder and colder.But at last Lucy noticed two other things. One was that the sky on the east sideof the hill was a little less dark than it had been an hour ago. The other was sometiny movement going on in the grass at her feet. At first she took no interest inthis. What did it matter? Nothing mattered now! But at last she saw thatwhatever-it-was had begun to move up the upright stones of the Stone Table.And now whatever-they-were were moving about on Aslan’s body. She peeredcloser. They were little grey things.“Ugh!” said Susan from the other side of the Table. “How beastly! There arehorrid little mice crawling over him. Go away, you little beasts.” And she raisedher hand to frighten them away.“Wait!” said Lucy, who had been looking at them more closely still. “Canyou see what they’re doing?”Both girls bent down and stared.“I do believe -” said Susan. “But how queer! They’re nibbling away at thecords!”“That’s what I thought,” said Lucy. “I think they’re friendly mice. Poor littlethings - they don’t realize he’s dead. They think it’ll do some good untying him.”It was quite definitely lighter by now. Each of the girls noticed for the firsttime the white face of the other. They could see the mice nibbling away; dozensand dozens, even hundreds, of little field mice. And at last, one by one, the ropeswere all gnawed through.The sky in the east was whitish by now and the stars were getting fainter - allexcept one very big one low down on the eastern horizon. They felt colder thanthey had been all night. The mice crept away again.The girls cleared away the remains of the gnawed ropes. Aslan looked morelike himself without them. Every moment his dead face looked nobler, as thelight grew and they could see it better.In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound. It had been so stillfor hours and hours that it startled them. Then another bird answered it. Soonthere were birds singing all over the place.It was quite definitely early morning now, not late night.“I’m so cold,” said Lucy.“So am I,” said Susan. “Let’s walk about a bit.”They walked to the eastern edge of the hill and looked down. The one bigstar had almost disappeared. The country all looked dark grey, but beyond, at thevery end of the world, the sea showed pale. The sky began to turn red. Theywalked to ands fro more times than they could count between the dead Aslan andthe eastern ridge, trying to keep warm; and oh, how tired their legs felt. Then atlast, as they stood for a moment looking out towards they sea and Cair Paravel(which they could now just make out) the red turned to gold along the line wherethe sea and the sky met and very slowly up came the edge of the sun. At thatmoment they heard from behind them a loud noise - a great cracking, deafeningnoise as if a giant had broken a giant’s plate.“What’s that?” said Lucy, clutching Susan’s arm.“I - I feel afraid to turn round,” said Susan; “something awful is happening.”“They’re doing something worse to Him,” said Lucy. “Come on!” And sheturned, pulling Susan round with her.The rising of the sun had made everything look so different - all colours andshadows were changed that for a moment they didn’t see the important thing.Then they did. The Stone Table was broken into two pieces by a great crack thatran down it from end to end; and there was no Aslan.“Oh, oh, oh!” cried the two girls, rushing back to the Table.“Oh, it’s too bad,” sobbed Lucy; “they might have left the body alone.”“Who’s done it?” cried Susan. “What does it mean? Is it magic?”“Yes!” said a great voice behind their backs. “It is more magic.” They lookedround. There, shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before,shaking his mane (for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.“Oh, Aslan!” cried both the children, staring up at him, almost as muchfrightened as they were glad.“Aren’t you dead then, dear Aslan?” said Lucy.“Not now,” said Aslan.“You’re not - not a - ?” asked Susan in a shaky voice. She couldn’t bringherself to say the word ghost. Aslan stooped his golden head and licked herforehead. The warmth of his breath and a rich sort of smell that seemed to hangabout his hair came all over her.“Do I look it?” he said.“Oh, you’re real, you’re real! Oh, Aslan!” cried Lucy, and both girls flungthemselves upon him and covered him with kisses.“But what does it all mean?” asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer.“It means,” said Aslan, “that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, thereis a magic deeper still which she did not know: Her knowledge goes back only tothe dawn of time. But if she could have looked a little further back, into thestillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would have read there adifferent incantation. She would have known that when a willing victim who hadcommitted no treachery was killed in a traitor’s stead, the Table would crack andDeath itself would start working backwards. And now -““Oh yes. Now?” said Lucy, jumping up and clapping her hands.“Oh, children,” said the Lion, “I feel my strength coming back to me. Oh,children, catch me if you can!” He stood for a second, his eyes very bright, hislimbs quivering, lashing himself with his tail. Then he made a leap high overtheir heads and landed on the other side of the Table. Laughing, though shedidn’t know why, Lucy scrambled over it to reach him. Aslan leaped again. Amad chase began. Round and round the hill-top he led them, now hopelessly outof their reach, now letting them almost catch his tail, now diving between them,now tossing them in the air with his huge and beautifully velveted paws andcatching them again, and now stopping unexpectedly so that all three of themrolled over together in a happy laughing heap of fur and arms and legs. It wassuch a romp as no one has ever had except in Narnia; and whether it was morelike playing with a thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never makeup her mind. And the funny thing was that when all three finally lay togetherpanting in the sun the girls no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty.“And now,” said Aslan presently, “to business. I feel I am going to roar. Youhad better put your fingers in your ears.”And they did. And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to roar hisface became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it. And they saw all thetrees in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring as grass bends in ameadow before the wind. Then he said,“We have a long journey to go. You must ride on me.” And he croucheddown and the children climbed on to his warm, golden back, and Susan sat first,holding on tightly to his mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly to Susan.And with a great heave he rose underneath them and then shot off, faster thanany horse could go, down hill and into the thick of the forest.That ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them inNarnia. Have you ever had a gallop on a horse? Think of that; and then takeaway the heavy noise of the hoofs and the jingle of the bits and imagine insteadthe almost noiseless padding of the great paws. Then imagine instead of theblack or grey or chestnut back of the horse the soft roughness of golden fur, andthe mane flying back in the wind. And then imagine you are going about twiceas fast as the fastest racehorse. But this is a mount that doesn’t need to be guidedand never grows tired. He rushes on and on, never missing his footing, neverhesitating, threading his way with perfect skill between tree trunks, jumping overbush and briar and the smaller streams, wading the larger, swimming the largestof all. And you are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs, butright across Narnia, in spring, down solemn avenues of beech and across sunnyglades of oak, through wild orchards of snow-white cherry trees, past roaringwaterfalls and mossy rocks and echoing caverns, up windy slopes alight withgorse bushes, and across the shoulders of heathery mountains and along giddyridges and down, down, down again into wild valleys and out into acres of blueflowers.It was nearly midday when they found themselves looking down a steephillside at a castle - a little toy castle it looked from where they stood - whichseemed to be all pointed towers. But the Lion was rushing down at such a speedthat it grew larger every moment and before they had time even to askthemselves what it was they were already on a level with it. And now it nolonger looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of them. No facelooked over the battlements and the gates were fast shut. And Aslan, not at allslacking his pace, rushed straight as a bullet towards it.“The Witch’s home!” he cried. “Now, children, hold tight.”Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down, and the childrenfelt as if they had left their insides behind them; for the Lion had gatheredhimself together for a greater leap than any he had yet made and jumped - or youmay call it flying rather than jumping - right over the castle wall. The two girls,breathless but unhurt, found themselves tumbling off his back in the middle of awide stone courtyard full of statues.Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER SIXTEENWHAT HAPPENED ABOUT THE STATUES“WHAT an extraordinary place!” cried Lucy. “All those stone animals -andpeople too! It’s -it’s like a museum.”“Hush,” said Susan, “Aslan’s doing something.”He was indeed. He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on him.Then without waiting a moment he whisked round - almost as if he had been acat chasing its tail -and breathed also on the stone dwarf, which (as youremember) was standing a few feet from the lion with his back to it. Then hepounced on a tall stone dryad which stood beyond the dwarf, turned rapidlyaside to deal with a stone rabbit on his right, and rushed on to two centaurs. Butat that moment Lucy said,“Oh, Susan! Look! Look at the lion.”I expect you’ve seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaperwhich is propped up in a grate against an unlit fire. And for a second nothingseems to have happened; and then you notice a tiny streak of flame creepingalong the edge of the newspaper. It was like that now. For a second after Aslanhad breathed upon him the stone lion looked just the same. Then a tiny streak ofgold began to run along his white marble back then it spread - then the colourseemed to lick all over him as the flame licks all over a bit of paper - then, whilehis hindquarters were still obviously stone, the lion shook his mane and all theheavy, stone folds rippled into living hair. Then he opened a great red mouth,warm and living, and gave a prodigious yawn. And now his hind legs had cometo life. He lifted one of them and scratched himself. Then, having caught sight ofAslan, he went bounding after him and frisking round him whimpering withdelight and jumping up to lick his face.Of course the children’s eyes turned to follow the lion; but the sight they sawwas so wonderful that they soon forgot about him. Everywhere the statues werecoming to life. The courtyard looked no longer like a museum; it looked morelike a zoo. Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing round him till he wasalmost hidden in the crowd. Instead of all that deadly white the courtyard wasnow a blaze of colours; glossy chestnut sides of centaurs, indigo horns ofunicorns, dazzling plumage of birds, reddy-brown of foxes, dogs and satyrs,yellow stockings and crimson hoods of dwarfs; and the birch-girls in silver, andthe beech-girls in fresh, transparent green, and the larch-girls in green so brightthat it was almost yellow. And instead of the deadly silence the whole place rangwith the sound of happy roarings, brayings, yelpings, barkings, squealings,cooings, neighings, stampings, shouts, hurrahs, songs and laughter.“Oh!” said Susan in a different tone. “Look! I wonder - I mean, is it safe?”Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the feet of the stonegiant.“It’s all right!” shouted Aslan joyously. “Once the feet are put right, all therest of him will follow.”“That wasn’t exactly what I meant,” whispered Susan to Lucy. But it was toolate to do anything about it now even if Aslan would have listened to her. Thechange was already creeping up the Giant’s legs. Now he was moving his feet. Amoment later he lifted his club off his shoulder, rubbed his eyes and said,“Bless me! I must have been asleep. Now! Where’s that dratted little Witchthat was running about on the ground. Somewhere just by my feet it was.” Butwhen everyone had shouted up to him to explain what had really happened, andwhen the Giant had put his hand to his ear and got them to repeat it all again sothat at last he understood, then he bowed down till his head was no further offthan the top of a haystack and touched his cap repeatedly to Aslan, beaming allover his honest ugly face. (Giants of any sort are now so rare in England and sofew giants are good-tempered that ten to one you have never seen a giant whenhis face is beaming. It’s a sight well worth looking at.)“Now for the inside of this house!” said Aslan. “Look alive, everyone. Upstairs and down stairs and in my lady’s chamber! Leave no corner unsearched.You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed.”And into the interior they all rushed and for several minutes the whole of thatdark, horrible, fusty old castle echoed with the opening of windows and witheveryone’s voices crying out at once, “Don’t forget the dungeons - Give us ahand with this door! Here’s another little winding stair - Oh! I say. Here’s a poorkangaroo. Call Aslan - Phew! How it smells in here - Look out for trap-doors Up here! There are a whole lot more on the landing!” But the best of all waswhen Lucy came rushing upstairs shouting out,“Aslan! Aslan! I’ve found Mr Tumnus. Oh, do come quick.”A moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding each other by bothhands and dancing round and round for joy. The little chap was none the worsefor having been a statue and was of course very interested in all she had to tellhim.But at last the ransacking of the Witch’s fortress was ended. The whole castlestood empty with every door and window open and the light and the sweetspring air flooding into all the dark and evil places which needed them so badly.The whole crowd of liberated statues surged back into the courtyard. And it wasthen that someone (Tumnus, I think) first said,“But how are we going to get out?” for Aslan had got in by a jump and thegates were still locked.“That’ll be all right,” said Aslan; and then, rising on his hind-legs, he bawledup at the Giant. “Hi! You up there,” he roared. “What’s your name?”“Giant Rumblebuffin, if it please your honour,” said the Giant, once moretouching his cap.“Well then, Giant Rumblebuffin,” said Aslan, “just let us out of this, willyou?”“Certainly, your honour. It will be a pleasure,” said Giant Rumblebuffin.“Stand well away from the gates, all you little ‘uns.” Then he strode to the gatehimself and bang - bang - bang - went his huge club. The gates creaked at thefirst blow, cracked at the second, and shivered at the third. Then he tackled thetowers on each side of them and after a few minutes of crashing and thuddingboth the towers and a good bit of the wall on each side went thundering down ina mass of hopeless rubble; and when the dust cleared it was odd, standing in thatdry, grim, stony yard, to see through the gap all the grass and waving trees andsparkling streams of the forest, and the blue hills beyond that and beyond themthe sky.“Blowed if I ain’t all in a muck sweat,” said the Giant, puffing like thelargest railway engine. “Comes of being out of condition. I suppose neither ofyou young ladies has such a thing as a pocket-handkerchee about you?”“Yes, I have,” said Lucy, standing on tip-toes and holding her handkerchiefup as far as she could reach.“Thank you, Missie,” said Giant Rumblebuffin, stooping down. Nextmoment Lucy got rather a fright for she found herself caught up in mid-airbetween the Giant’s finger and thumb. But just as she was getting near his facehe suddenly started and then put her gently back on the ground muttering, “Blessme! I’ve picked up the little girl instead. I beg your pardon, Missie, I thoughtyou was the handkerchee!”“No, no,” said Lucy laughing, “here it is!” This time he managed to get it butit was only about the same size to him that a saccharine tablet would be to you,so that when she saw him solemnly rubbing it to and fro across his great redface, she said, “I’m afraid it’s not much use to you, Mr Rumblebuffin.”“Not at all. Not at all,” said the giant politely. “Never met a nicerhandkerchee. So fine, so handy. So - I don’t know how to describe it.”“What a nice giant he is!” said Lucy to Mr Tumnus.“Oh yes,” replied the Faun. “All the Buffins always were. One of the mostrespected of all the giant families in Narnia. Not very clever, perhaps (I neverknew a giant that was), but an old family. With traditions, you know. If he’dbeen the other sort she’d never have turned him into stone.”At this point Aslan clapped his paws together and called for silence.“Our day’s work is not yet over,” he said, “and if the Witch is to be finallydefeated before bed-time we must find the battle at once.”“And join in, I hope, sir!” added the largest of the Centaurs.“Of course,” said Aslan. “And now! Those who can’t keep up - that is,children, dwarfs, and small animals - must ride on the backs of those who can that is, lions, centaurs, unicorns, horses, giants and eagles. Those who are goodwith their noses must come in front with us lions to smell out where the battle is.Look lively and sort yourselves.”And with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did. The most pleased ofthe lot was the other lion who kept running about everywhere pretending to bevery busy but really in order to say to everyone he met. “Did you hear what hesaid? Us Lions. That means him and me. Us Lions. That’s what I like aboutAslan. No side, no stand-off-ishness. Us Lions. That meant him and me.” Atleast he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with three dwarfs, onedryad, two rabbits, and a hedgehog. That steadied him a bit.When all were ready (it was a big sheep-dog who actually helped Aslan mostin getting them sorted into their proper order) they set out through the gap in thecastle wall. At first the lions and dogs went nosing about in all directions. Butthen suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave a bay. There was notime lost after that. Soon all the dogs and lions and wolves and other huntinganimals were going at full speed with their noses to the ground, and all theothers, streaked out for about half a mile behind them, were following as fast asthey could. The noise was like an English fox-hunt only better because everynow and then with the music of the hounds was mixed the roar of the other lionand sometimes the far deeper and more awful roar of Aslan himself. Faster andfaster they went as the scent became easier and easier to follow. And then, just asthey came to the last curve in a narrow, winding valley, Lucy heard above allthese noises another noise - a different one, which gave her a queer feelinginside. It was a noise of shouts and shrieks and of the clashing of metal againstmetal.Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the reason.There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan’s army fightingdesperately against the crowd of horrible creatures whom she had seen last night;only now, in the daylight, they looked even stranger and more evil and moredeformed. There also seemed to be far more of them. Peter’s army - which hadtheir backs to her looked terribly few. And there werestatues dotted all over thebattlefield, so apparently the Witch had been using her wand. But she did notseem to be using it now. She was fighting with her stone knife. It was Peter shewas fightin - both of them going at it so hard that Lucy could hardly make outwhat was happening; she only saw the stone knife and Peter’s sword flashing soquickly that they looked like three knives and three swords. That pair were in thecentre. On each side the line stretched out. Horrible things were happeningwherever she looked.“Off my back, children,” shouted Aslan. And they both tumbled off. Thenwith a roar that shook all Narnia from the western lamp-post to the shores of theeastern sea the great beast flung himself upon the White Witch. Lucy saw herface lifted towards him for one second with an expression of terror andamazement. Then Lion and Witch had rolled over together but with the Witchunderneath; and at the same moment all war-like creatures whom Aslan had ledfrom the Witch’s house rushed madly on the enemy lines, dwarfs with theirbattleaxes, dogs with teeth, the Giant with his club (and his feet also crusheddozens of the foe), unicorns with their horns, centaurs with swords and hoofs.And Peter’s tired army cheered, and the newcomers roared, and the enemysquealed and gibbered till the wood re-echoed with the din of that onset.Narnia 1 - The Lion, The Witch andThe WardrobeCHAPTER SEVENTEENTHE HUNTING OF THE WHITE STAGTHE battle was all over a few minutes after their arrival. Most of the enemyhad been killed in the first charge of Aslan and his -companions; and when thosewho were still living saw that the Witch was dead they either gave themselves upor took to flight. The next thing that Lucy knew was that Peter and Aslan wereshaking hands. It was strange to her to see Peter looking as he looked now - hisface was so pale and stern and he seemed so much older.“It was all Edmund’s doing, Aslan,” Peter was saying. “We’d have beenbeaten if it hadn’t been for him. The Witch was turning our troops into stoneright and left. But nothing would stop him. He fought his way through threeogres to where she was just turning one of your leopards into a statue. And whenhe reached her he had sense to bring his sword smashing down on her wandinstead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made a statue himselffor his pains. That was the mistake all the rest were making. Once her wand wasbroken we began to have some chance - if we hadn’t lost so many already. Hewas terribly wounded. We must go and see him.”They found Edmund in charge of Mrs Beaver a little way back from thefighting line. He was covered with blood, his mouth was open, and his face anasty green colour.“Quick, Lucy,” said Aslan.And then, almost for the first time, Lucy remembered the precious cordialthat had been given her for a Christmas present. Her hands trembled so muchthat she could hardly undo the stopper, but she managed it in the end and poureda few drops into her brother’s mouth.“There are other people wounded,” said Aslan while she was still lookingeagerly into Edmund’s pale face and wondering if the cordial would have anyresult.“Yes, I know,” said Lucy crossly. “Wait a minute.”“Daughter of Eve,” said Aslan in a graver voice, “others also are at the pointof death. Must more people die for Edmund?”“I’m sorry, Aslan,” said Lucy, getting up and going with him. And for thenext half-hour they were busy - she attending to the wounded while he restoredthose who had been turned into stone. When at last she was free to come back toEdmund she found him standing on his feet and not only healed of his woundsbut looking better than she had seen him look - oh, for ages; in fact ever since hisfirst term at that horrid school which was where he had begun to go wrong. Hehad become his real old self again and could look you in the face. And there onthe field of battle Aslan made him a knight.“Does he know,” whispered Lucy to Susan, “what Aslan did for him? Doeshe know what the arrangement with the Witch really was?”“Hush! No. Of course not,” said Susan.“Oughtn’t he to be told?” said Lucy.“Oh, surely not,” said Susan. “It would be too awful for him. Think howyou’d feel if you were he.”“All the same I think he ought to know,” said Lucy. But at that moment theywere interrupted.That night they slept where they were. How Aslan provided food for them allI don’t know; but somehow or other they found themselves all sitting down onthe grass to a fine high tea at about eight o’clock. Next day they began marchingeastward down the side of the great river. And the next day after that, at aboutteatime, they actually reached the mouth. The castle of Cair Paravel on its littlehill towered up above them; before them were the sands, with rocks and littlepools of salt water, and seaweed, and the smell of the sea and long miles ofbluish-green waves breaking for ever and ever on the beach. And oh, the cry ofthe sea-gulls! Have you heard it? Can you remember?That evening after tea the four children all managed to get down to the beachagain and get their shoes and stockings off and feel the sand between their toes.But next day was more solemn. For then, in the Great Hall of Cair Paravel - thatwonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west wall hung with peacock’sfeathers and the eastern door which looks towards the sea, in the presence of alltheir friends and to the sound of trumpets, Aslan solemnly crowned them and ledthem to the four thrones amid deafening shouts of, “Long Live King Peter! LongLive Queen Susan! Long Live King Edmund! Long Live Queen Lucy!”“Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well, Sonsof Adam! Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!” said Aslan.And through the eastern door, which was wide open, came the voices of themermen and the mermaids swimming close to the shore and singing in honour oftheir new Kings and Queens.So the children sat on their thrones and sceptres were put into their hands andthey gave rewards and honours to all their friends, to Tumnus the Faun, and tothe Beavers, and Giant Rumblebuffin, to the leopards, and the good centaurs,and the good dwarfs, and to the lion. And that night there was a great feast inCair Paravel, and revelry and dancing, and gold flashed and wine flowed, andanswering to the music inside, but stranger, sweeter, and more piercing, came themusic of the sea people.But amidst all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. Andwhen the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn’t there they said nothing aboutit. For Mr Beaver had warned them, “He’ll be coming and going,” he had said.“One day you’ll see him and another you won’t. He doesn’t like being tied downand of course he has other countries to attend to. It’s quite all right. He’ll oftendrop in. Only you mustn’t press him. He’s wild,’ you know. Not like a tamelion.”And now, as you see, this story is nearly (but not quite) at an end. These twoKings and two Queens governed Narnia well, and long and happy was theirreign. At first much of their time was spent in seeking out the remnants of theWhite Witch’s army and destroying them, and indeed for a long time there wouldbe news of evil things lurking in the wilder parts of the forest - a haunting hereand a killing there, a glimpse of a werewolf one month and a rumour of a hag thenext. But in the end all that foul brood was stamped out. And they made goodlaws and kept the peace and saved good trees from being unnecessarily cutdown, and liberated young dwarfs and young satyrs from being sent to school,and generally stopped busybodies and interferers and encouraged ordinarypeople who wanted to live and let live. And they drove back the fierce giants(quite a different sort from Giant Rumblebuffin) on the north of Narnia whenthese ventured across the frontier. And they entered into friendship and alliancewith countries beyond the sea and paid them visits of state and received visits ofstate from them. And they themselves grew and changed as the years passedover them. And Peter became a tall and deep-chested man and a great warrior,and he was called King Peter the Magnificent. And Susan grew into a tall andgracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the kings of thecountries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand inmarriage. And she was called Susan the Gentle. Edmund was a graver andquieter man than Peter, and great in council and judgement. He was called KingEdmund the Just. But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden-haired, and allprinces in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her own people calledher Queen Lucy the Valiant.So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this worldit was only as one remembers a dream. And one year it fell out that Tumnus(who was a middle-aged Faun by now and beginning to be stout) came downriver and brought them news that the White Stag had once more appeared in hisparts - the White Stag who would give you wishes if you caught him. So thesetwo Kings and two Queens with the principal members of their court, rode ahunting with horns and hounds in the Western Woods to follow the White Stag.And they had not hunted long before they had a sight of him. And he led them agreat pace over rough and smooth and through thick and thin, till the horses ofall the courtiers were tired out and these four were still following. And they sawthe stag enter into a thicket where their horses could not follow. Then said KingPeter (for they talked in quite a different style now, having been Kings andQueens for so long), “Fair Consorts, let us now alight from our horses andfollow this beast into the thicket; for in all my days I never hunted a noblerquarry.”“Sir,” said the others, “even so let us do.”So they alighted and tied their horses to trees and went on into the thickwood on foot. And as soon as they had entered it Queen Susan said,“Fair friends, here is a great marvel, for I seem to see a tree of iron.”“Madam,” said,King Edmund, “if you look well upon it you shall see it is apillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof.”“By the Lion’s Mane, a strange device,” said King Peter, “to set a lanternhere where the trees cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it werelit it should give light to no man!”“Sir,” said Queen Lucy. “By likelihood when this post and this lamp were sethere there were smaller trees in the place, or fewer, or none. For this is a youngwood and the iron post is old.” And they stood looking upon it. Then said KingEdmund,“I know not how it is, but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely.It runs in my mind that I have seen the like before; as it were in a dream, or inthe dream of a dream.”“Sir,” answered they all, “it is even so with us also.”“And more,” said Queen Lucy, “for it will not go out of my mind that if wepass this post and lantern either we shall find strange adventures or else somegreat change of our fortunes.”“Madam,” said King Edmund, “the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also.”“And in mine, fair brother,” said King Peter.“And in mine too,” said Queen Susan. “Wherefore by my counsel we shalllightly return to our horses and follow this White Stag no further.”“Madam,” said King Peter, “therein I pray thee to have me excused. Fornever since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hands toany high matter, as battles, quests, feats of arms, acts of justice, and the like, andthen given over; but always what we have taken in hand, the same we haveachieved.”“Sister,” said Queen Lucy, “my royal brother speaks rightly. And it seems tome we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back fromfollowing so noble a beast as now we have in chase.”“And so say I,” said King Edmund. “And I have such desire to find thesignification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for therichest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands.”“Then in the name of Aslan,” said Queen Susan, “if ye will all have it so, letus go on and take the adventure that shall fall to us.”So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket, and before they had gone ascore of paces they all remembered that the thing they had seen was called alamppost, and before they had gone twenty more they noticed that they were.making their way not through branches but through coats. And next momentthey all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty room, and Theywere no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but just Peter, Susan,Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes. It was the same day and the same hour ofthe day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide. Mrs Macready andthe visitors were still talking in the passage; but luckily they never came into theempty room and so the children weren’t caught.And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn’t been that theyfelt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coats out of hiswardrobe were missing. And the Professor, who was a very remarkable man,didn’t tell them not to be silly or not to tell lies, but believed the whole story.“No,” he said, “I don’t think it will be any good trying to go back through thewardrobe door to get the coats. You won’t get into Narnia again by thatroute. Nor would the coats be much use by now if you did!Eh? What’s that? Yes, of course you’ll get back to Narniaagain some day. Once a King in Narnia, always a King inNarnia. But don’t go trying to use the same route twice.Indeed, don’t try to get there at all. It’ll happen whenyou’re not looking for it. And don’t talk too much about iteven among yourselves. And don’t mention it to anyone elseunless you find that they’vehad adventures of the same sort themselves. What’s that? Howwill you know? Oh, you’ll know all right. Odd things theysay - even their looks - will let the secret out. Keep youreyes open. Bless me, what do they teach them at theseschools?And that is the very end of the adventure of the wardrobe.But if the Professor was right it was only the beginning ofthe adventures of Narnia.'"
